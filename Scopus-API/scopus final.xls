The purpose of this research is to propose a tool for designing a microcredit risk pricing strategy for borrowers of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Design/methodology/approach. Considering the specific characteristics of microcredit borrowers, we first estimate and measure microcredit risk through the default probability, applying a parametric technique such as logistic regression and a non-parametric technique based on an artificial neural network, looking for the model with the highest predictive power. Secondly, based on the Basel III internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, we use the credit risk measurement for each borrower to design a pricing model that sets microcredit interest rates according to default risk. Findings. The paper demonstrates that the probability of default for each borrower is more accurately adjusted using the artificial neural network. Furthermore, our results suggest that, given a profitability target for the MFI, the microcredit interest rate for clients with a lower level of credit risk should be lower than a standard, fixed rate to achieve the profitability target. Practical implications. This tool allows us, on the one hand, to measure and assess credit risk and minimize default losses in MFIs and, secondly, to promote their competitiveness by reducing interest rates, capital requirements, and credit losses, favoring the financial self-sustainability of these institutions. Social implications. Our findings have the potential to make microfinance institutions fairer and more equitable in their lending practices by providing microcredit with risk-adjusted pricing. Furthermore, our findings can contribute to the design of government policies aimed at promoting the financial and social inclusion of vulnerable people. Originality. The personal characteristics of microcredit clients, mainly reputation and moral solvency, are crucial to the default behavior of microfinance borrowers. These factors should have an impact on the pricing of microcredit. © 2024 by the authors.","credit risk; logit; microfinance institutions; neural network; pricing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205057366"

These innovative technologies are revolutionizing smart grid management by introducing novel approaches that enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability, all while securing information across distributed grid components. AI empowers predictive analytics and real-time optimization, while Blockchain ensures secure and transparent transactions, laying the foundation for a more resilient and adaptive electrical grid system. This article introduces a novel Secure, Distributed, and Collaborative Learning (SDCL) framework for the smart grid. The SDCL framework leverages advances in distributed learning and blockchain technologies to provide scalability, secure data exchange, and rapid response capabilities. The proposed architecture not only enables secure data and model exchange among different microgrids but also facilitates the integration of multiple microgrids and distributed network operators. This integration enables the correlation of unforeseen events and enhances the management and control of emerging failures. Our resilient, blockchain-based architecture optimizes information sharing and security levels within the blockchain, accommodating diverse requirements for smart grid services.

In the wake of the ongoing digital transformation across various spheres of life, the incorporation of new digital technologies and the utilization of artificial intelligence hold the potential to contribute significantly to the attainment of these objectives. Leveraging the scalability inherent in digital business models, coupled with the widespread adoption of smartphones, facilitates the broad dissemination of digital healthcare services, even within emerging and developing nations. This inquiry adopts a quantitative research methodology to examine the implications of this phenomenon. In 2023, a cohort of 103 experts within German-speaking countries participated in an online survey, offering their insights into the impact of digitalization on health-related sustainability goals. The survey encompassed an assessment of the influence of digital technologies and AI on 13 sub-goals within the health domain, as well as on six additional SDGs. The comprehensive evaluation revealed that all 19 sub-goals exhibit a discernible medium to high impact. The analysis underscores that domains such as education and early warning systems are particularly amenable to digital interventions. Conversely, endeavors targeting the reduction of tobacco consumption or drug abuse may benefit from complementary measures. Conclusively, this study not only presents a developmental perspective on modeling but also formulates ten actionable recommendations, elucidating potential avenues for advancing the integration of digital technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance health-related sustainability goals. © 2024 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Digital transformation; Global health; Healthcare; Sustainable Development Goals","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210398236"

Our research will fill this research gap by exploring impacts of urban climate adaptation on firms' investment decisions. Regarding the 2017 China's climate adaptation pilot cities (CAPC) policy as a quasi-natural experiment and employing the difference-in-differences (DID) method, we investigate whether and how urban climate adaptation from CAPC policy affects firms' investment decisions based on A-share listed firms. Our findings indicate that urban climate adaptation has significantly enhanced firms' investment by 14.18 %. This effect can be attributed to the reduction of firms' bankruptcy risk and increased optimism in analysts' earnings forecasts, rather than the alleviation of financial constraints. Additionally, our paper finds that impacts of urban climate adaptation on firms' investment decisions are more prominent for non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs), firms in the growth stage, and those situated in cities with high climate risk perception. These findings enhance understanding about the role of urban climate adaptation in shaping firms' investment behaviors in developing countries and provide critical insights for the formulation of effective climate governance policies. © 2024","Climate governance; Difference-in-differences; Firms' investment decisions; Urban climate adaptation","China; Climate governance; Climate mitigations; Difference-in-differences; Differences-in-differences; Firm' investment decision; Green waves; Investment decisions; Pilot city; Urban climate adaptation; Urban climates; adaptive management; climate change; developing world; environmental economics; environmental policy; industrial investment; mitigation; statistical analysis; urban climate","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211016692"

In this context, anomaly detection (AD) becomes a valuable methodology, as it supports maintenance activities in the manufacturing sector, allowing for early intervention to prevent energy waste and maintain optimal performance. Here, an AD-based method is proposed and studied to support energy-saving predictive maintenance of production lines using time series acquired directly from the field. This paper proposes a deep echo state network (DeepESN)-based method for anomaly detection by analyzing energy consumption data sets from production lines. Compared with traditional prediction methods, such as recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM), although both models show similar time series trends, the DeepESN-based method studied here appears to have some advantages, such as timelier error detection and higher prediction accuracy. In addition, the DeepESN-based method has been shown to be more accurate in predicting the occurrence of failure. The proposed solution has been extensively tested in a real-world pilot case consisting of an automated metal filter production line equipped with industrial smart meters to acquire energy data during production phases; the time series, composed of 88 variables associated with energy parameters, was then processed using the techniques introduced earlier. The results show that our method enables earlier error detection and achieves higher prediction accuracy when running on an edge device. © 2024 by the authors.","anomaly detection; artificial intelligence; echo state network; edge computing; energy consumption; industrial internet of things; predictive maintenance","Competition; Cost reduction; Deep neural networks; Long short-term memory; Anomaly detection; Echo state networks; Edge computing; Energy-consumption; Industrial internet of thing; Network-based; Neural-networks; Predictive maintenance; Production line; Times series; Predictive maintenance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206561632"

This paper introduces an approach to Pest Control (PC) in Tea Plantations (TP), focusing on using an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a Pest Detection (PD) and precision spraying system. Leveraging the capabilities of the DJI Agras T40, a UAV specifically engineered for agricultural use, this system incorporates a Deep Learning (DL) built on the DenseNet-121 architecture. This model is refined to accurately detect and accurately evaluate the infection rates of six prevalent tea pests. In order to intelligently identify pesticide dispersion, the UAV uses advanced technology. This provides targeted deployment, optimizes the utilization of resources, and minimizes impact on the environment. The method's effectiveness has been proved by simulation experiments, recommending that it has real-world possibilities. A sustainable and flexible approach to several pest cases can be achieved by pairing the Sprayer Control Module (SCM) with the PD. Such integration significantly advances autonomous Pest Control Systems (PCS), enhances PC precision and performance, and minimizes the environmental impact. ©2025 The Authors.

Due to their importance to society and the work they do towards diversity integration and social sustainability, they have recently attracted much attention in academic literature. For this reason, the main objective of this study was to analyse the survival of social enterprises, identifying key variables that condition their continuity in the market or their failure. The initial sample consisted of 999 social enterprises for the year 2022. The Altman Z-score and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms were used to obtain the basic survival patterns. The main findings were that, on average, social enterprises are highly experienced companies and only one-third of them are at risk of bankruptcy. This means that most of these enterprises can continue their social function. Moreover, the results of return on assets (ROA), equity and debt turnover can predict being at risk of bankruptcy of social enterprises. This study contributes to the scarce academic literature on social enterprises and promotes the existence of such enterprises for social and economic sustainability. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study proposes a novel hybrid Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) to optimize credit risk assessment in SCF. By leveraging BallMapper (BM) topological data analysis model and network-based features, the proposed model provides deeper insights into credit risk factors, enhancing the accuracy and dependability of credit risk evaluation for SMEs. Results demonstrate that the proposed BallMapper- Graph Neural Network (BM-GNN) model achieves higher accuracy and F1-scores, outperforming traditional machine learning approaches. Notably, incorporating network-based features alongside financial ratios yields the most favorable results in credit risk assessment. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model highlights the pivotal role of certain features in predicting bankruptcy, offering valuable insights for risk mitigation strategies. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of TDA and GNN in financial applications, particularly in credit risk evaluation for SMEs in supply chain finance.

Besides, they play a crucial role in equipping learners with practical skills and fostering hands-on experience to defend against cyber-attacks. Many Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in developed countries have already embraced the promise of CC to raise educational standards. However, the pace of its adoption in developing countries has stagnated. Moreover, existing solutions in the literature are not sustainable. They either rely on on-premise infrastructure or are bound by a single cloud service provider. Consequently, they are likely prone to failures and a sudden outage. To fill this gap, this paper is a first that comprehensively addresses the above issues and introduces a federated hybrid CC system based on an extension of Apache Virtual Computing Lab (VCL). The proposed system provides an independent open-source implementation, greater configuration flexibility, and methodological improvements as compared to existing studies in the literature. In addition, it promotes the sustainability of the CC services, extensible cloud architecture, and fault tolerance. VCL is primarily focused on provisioning Virtual Laboratories (VL) for remote cybersecurity and computer networks education, with potential expansion to other domains of engineering education. In addition, this paper introduces GPT-TerminalPro, a terminal-based tool driven by OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT-3.5) that provides intelligent assistance to users while performing lab tasks. To experimentally evaluate the VCL's performance, the standard Linux tools as well as the Apache benchmark and httperf HTTP load generators are utilized. VCL has been tested with 30 users and 61 virtual user computing environments provisioning to validate the overall performance. The results are fascinating: the provisioning time including all VCL background tasks is always less than a minute and utilizes fewer computing resources while providing a better user experience. This paper will encourage the adoption of CC in low-income countries. © 2024 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Blended learning; Cybersecurity education; Federated hybrid cloud computing; Sustainable cloud computing; Virtual and remote laboratory","Benchmarking; Cloud computing architecture; Computer operating systems; Cybersecurity; E-learning; Fault tolerance; Laboratories; Network security; Open systems; Blended learning; Cloud-computing; Cyber security; Cyber-security educations; Federated hybrid cloud computing; Hybrid Cloud computing; Remote laboratories; Sustainable cloud computing; Virtual computing; Virtual laboratories; Developing countries","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194079798"

The validity of the metrics is assessed by means of their practical application to both simulated and real data. The results from the comparison of alternative machine learning models to simulated data are aligned with the generating models, in general indicating linear regression models as the most accurate, regression tree models as the most fair, Random Forest models as the most robust; and leading to model explanations similar to the true ones from the generating model. The outcomes from the application of Random Forest models to real data show that the proposed RGB metrics are more interpretable and more consistent with the expectations, with respect to standard metrics such as AUC, RMSE and Shapley values.

However, borrowers’ missed payments have negatively impacted the industry’s sustainable growth. It is imperative to create a system that can correctly predict loan defaults to lessen the damage brought on by defaulters. The goal of this study is to fill the gap in the literature by exploring the feasibility of developing prediction models for P2P loan defaults without relying heavily on personal data while also focusing on identifying key variables influencing borrowers’ repayment capacity through systematic feature selection and exploratory data analysis. Given this, this study aims to create a computational model that aids lenders in determining the approval or rejection of a loan application, relying on the financial data provided by applicants. The selected dataset, sourced from an open database, contains 8578 transaction records and includes 14 attributes related to financial information, with no personal data included. A loan dataset is first subjected to an in-depth exploratory data analysis to find behaviors connected to loan defaults. Subsequently, diverse and noteworthy machine learning classification algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and XGBoost, were employed to build models capable of discerning borrowers who repay their loans from those who do not. Our findings indicate that borrowers who fail to comply with their lenders’ credit policies, pay elevated interest rates, and possess low FICO ratings are at a higher likelihood of defaulting. Furthermore, elevated risk is observed among clients who obtain loans for small businesses. All classification models, including XGBoost and Random Forest, successfully developed and performed satisfactorily and achieved an accuracy of over 80%. When the decision threshold is set to 0.4, the best performance for predicting loan defaulters is achieved using logistic regression, which accurately identifies 83% of the defaulted loans, with a recall of 83%, precision of 21% and f1 score of 33%. © 2024 by the authors.","Decision Tree; Loan Defaults; Logistic Regression; Machine Learning; Naïve Bayes; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine; XGBoost","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200686655"

The assessment utilizes the regular variation framework from extreme value theory and consists of two parts: (1) evaluating the extent to which PERSIANN-CDR can capture precipitation extremes through inference on an asymptotic dependence parameter, concluding that the level of asymptotic dependence is moderate throughout the region; (2) developing a tail dependence regression modeling framework and a Gibbs posterior approach for inference to investigate the degree to which elevation and topographic heterogeneity impact the level of asymptotic dependence, finding that the inclusion of a set of meteorological covariates, when combined with the PERSIANN-CDR output, yields an increased level of asymptotic dependence with station data. © 2024 The Author(s).

Traditional methodologies for failure diagnosis have relied on analyzing electrical and mechanical data signatures across time, frequency, and time–frequency domains, necessitating extensive technical acumen and considerable time investment. To address these limitations, this study integrates artificial intelligence, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with traditional diagnostic signals, thus reducing the requirement for specialized knowledge and expediting the diagnostic process. Employing pre-processing techniques such as wavelet and short-time Fourier transforms, the proposed AI-based method effectively uncovers latent patterns within vibration data from electric motors under varied operational conditions. Our findings reveal that the method achieves optimal classification accuracy (100%) with both STFT and a combination of STFT and wavelet techniques, and slightly less with wavelet alone (98.5%). Additionally, the investigation into the method's resilience against noise affirms its robustness, with accuracies marginally affected even at high noise levels (up to 60%).

However, the climate and energy crises caused by the intensification of extreme events, such as recent extreme weather and geopolitical risks, have led the public to turn their attention to research in the field of clean energy. Therefore, this paper uses one-class SVM (support vector machine) techniques to identify extreme volatility in natural gas prices induced by significant occurrences (e.g., wars, financial crises, and COVID-19) and then investigates whether considering extreme volatility in natural gas over different volatile periods (short- and long-term periods) improves volatility forecasting accuracy within the context of a GARCH-MIDAS framework. The in-sample analyses demonstrate that extreme shocks increase natural gas price volatility and that the asymmetric effects are more influential than the short- and long-term extreme volatility effects.

The power sector is one of the leading domains implementing such appealing and effective technologies for diverse applications as a part of the digital transformation of electric networks. A power system's low-frequency oscillation (LFO) is a non-threatening but slow-burning problem that might cause complete network failure unless adequately handled. This article proposes a state-of-the-art procedure of LFO damping in electric power networks via the sine cosine algorithm and deep learning (DL) technique. It uses two networks of power systems, in which the synchronous generator is fitted with a power system stabilizer (PSS) in the case of the first network; in the other, the synchronous machine is conjoined to the PSS that coordinates with a unified power flow controller. The proposal is developed based on the statistical assessment of the analyzed networks to improve the LFO damping via real-time adjustment of PSS parameters/variables. The proposed technique was evaluated using power system stability performance measuring criteria, such as the eigenvalue and minimum damping ratio. In the end, the effectivity of the stability-gaining procedure is also tested by time-domain simulation to implement in real-time. The study also dealt with a comparative investigation and discussion of the findings of some published works to conclude the capability of the proposed DL tool for stability improvement of the system in real-time by removing undesirable LFOs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Energy sustainability; Flexible alternating current transmitting systems; Machine learning; Meta-heuristic; Power system stabilizers; Sine cosine algorithm","Electric power system stability; Alternating current; Energy sustainability; Flexible alternating current transmitting system; Frequency oscillations; Lower frequencies; Machine-learning; Metaheuristic; Oscillations damping; Power System Stabilizer; Sine-cosine algorithm; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202344252"

Solid experimental evidence is yet inadequate to set the functional rules for the new technology. Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyse the experience of undergraduate students’ interaction with ChatGPT and contribute to identifying the problems arising from the widespread use of artificial intelligence. Methods: Junior university students (N = 25) were assigned the task of working on their seminar essays with the aid of ChatGPT. Most students were novices with this tool (the study was conducted in the spring of 2023). Their essays were analysed qualitatively, according to the principles of the general inductive approach. Results and Conclusions: The initial attitudes towards artificial intelligence were almost equally distributed from enthusiastic to indifferent and cautious, with one student refusing to interact with the chatbot on ideological grounds. After the first experience, most of the students declared themselves adopters of the new technology. We have found some evidence for enhancing critical thinking competence when using ChatGPT, as well as examples of unquestioned reliance on its outputs. The tendency to personification of the chatbot was apparent in the students' essays. Implications: The findings show how easily the students embrace artificial intelligence and suggest a failure of any attempts for its strict regulation. This, on the other hand, underlines the need for emphasis on personal and research-oriented approaches in teaching and learning. © 2024 The Authors.

In small emerging economies, proactive risk management is crucial as major disruptions require SOs to redirect resources into recovery efforts. Therefore, SOs prioritize risk reduction, proactively minimizing the possibility of major disruption to ensure the industry’s long-term advancement. However, SOs frequently focus on residual risk mitigation while ignoring their exposure to inherent risk. This study investigated the inherent risks associated with power supply management using the SO’s operations and pertinent third parties. It used a seasonal multivariate strategy to identify risk factors, create univariate distribution models, and generate multivariate distributions using the copula method. Joint risk exposure was calculated using different percentile metrics for each scenario, allowing for a comparison of exposure levels. The study found that risk variables can sometimes reinforce or offset each other, impacting exposure behaviour. Exposure levels indicate periods of increased or decreased exposure to risk variables. Copula-modelled interdependencies captured larger exposure levels but had lower unit likelihoods, presenting less conservative exposure forecasts for SO managers. Case 1 exhibited the highest exposure levels in the early dry season (0.237 and 0.179), while case 2 showed peak exposure levels in the late wet season (1.009 and 0.948), along with cases 3 (0.977 and 0.908) and 4 (0.950 and 0.879). © 2024 by the authors.","electricity sector; inherent risk; power mix; risk management; system operator","Electricity sector; Exposure level; Inherent risk; Power; Power mix; Power supply; Risks management; Supply management; System operator; Third parties","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214532069"

The flexibility with which econometric models can take into account the highly non-linear and asymmetric dependence in financial returns is a critical component of their capacity to forecast extreme events. Therefore, this study aims to forecast time-varying Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall dependence as a predictive densitybased regime changes over time. To achieve this, a non-stationary Markov-switching generalized Autoregressive score model nested with copula is estimated using expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm. Extending this non-stationary model is quite challenging, as it requires specifications not only on how the usual parameters change over time but also those with mass distribution components. Dynamics of the estimated autoregressive score allowed the copula parameters to respond rapidly to time-varying key systemic parameters and risk. This is because regime changes are allowed to oscillated between high and low regimes. This is a clear indication of a regime shift in the parameters of an estimated model. Using the minimum score combining, six extreme value distributions are combined to the estimated MS(2)-GAS(1)-copula model and assessed the performance of each combined model 5 days and 30 days forecasting of value-at-risk and expected shortfall. The results of the forecasting performance indicated that the MS(2)-GAS(1)-GPD is the best model to model and forecast Value-at-risk and expected shortfall for the Botswana stock market. This is a promising technique for stochastic modeling of time-varying Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. In addition, a foundation is provided for future researchers to conduct studies on emerging markets. These results are also important for risk managers and investors. © 2024, Austrian Statistical Society.

Methods: Demographics, tests, comorbidities, and drugs were collected for a cohort of 974 elderly patients with CHD. A prospective analysis was performed to evaluate predictive performances of the developed models. External validation of models was performed in a series of 112 elderly CHD patients with anemia. Results: The overall one-year mortality was 43.6%. Risk factors included heart rate, chronic heart failure, tachycardia and β receptor blockers. Protective factors included hemoglobin, albumin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), aspirin, clopidogrel, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and statins. Compared with other algorithms, an ensemble machine learning model performed the best with area under the curve (95% confidence interval) being 0.828 (0.805–0.870) and Brier score being 0.170. Calibration and density curves further confirmed favorable predicted probability and discriminative ability of an ensemble machine learning model. External validation of Ensemble Model also exhibited good performance with area under the curve (95% confidence interval) being 0.825 (0.734–0.916) and Brier score being 0.185. Patients in the high-risk group had more than six-fold probability of one-year mortality compared with those in the low-risk group (P < 0.001). Shaley Additive exPlanation identified the top five risk factors that associated with one-year mortality were hemoglobin, albumin, eGFR, LVEF, and ACEIs/ARBs.

The traditional approach to estimating recurrence intervals is highly reliant on prior knowledge and expert experience, which often leads to considerable error margins. Recent advances in high-performance monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) achieving great successes in various areas have renewed interest in identifying failure precursors and predicting seismic events. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm wrapped stochastic configuration networks (GAWSCN) approach to explore seismic physics for time-to-failure prediction. Specifically, stochastic configuration networks (SCN), a novel randomized learning paradigm, is utilized to learn essential seismic information from acoustic emission signals. To further enhance the generalization capability and alleviate overfitting, a regularization technique is imposed during the SCN training to establish a robust seismic prediction model. In particular, a genetic algorithm is integrated with SCN to optimize the selection of pertinent seismic features and further improve prediction performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our GAWSCN method outperforms other machine learning methods across evaluation metrics.

The model is tuned to adapt to different economic periods split into a single financial year. In the process of tuning and training the mathematical analysis model, deep learning is used. The learning paradigm trains the risks and modifying features from expert opinion and previous predictions. Based on these three factors, the risk for the current investment is forecasted. The forecast aids in improving the new investment feasibilities with minimal risks and model modifications. The frequent market status is identified for preventing unnecessary risk-oriented forecasts using the training performed. Therefore, the proposed model is reliable in identifying risks and providing better investment recommendations.  © 2024-IOS Press.

Since these building structures suffer an increase in axial loads to the main structural elements due to green retrofits (e.g., installation of energy equipment/devices, roof gardens) as one of the sustainable building solutions and/or vertical extensions, their capacities can be reduced. This paper aims to propose a rapid estimation method incorporating a previously developed machine-learning model to find an allowable range of axial loads for reinforced concrete columns using simple structural details for enhancement in the sustainability performance of existing buildings in structural and energy fields. The methodology consists of two steps: (1) a machine-learning-based failure detection model, and (2) column damage limits proposed by previous researchers. To demonstrate this proposed method, an existing building structure built in the 1990s was selected, and the allowable range for the target structure was computed for both exterior and interior columns. A machine-learning-based method showed that axial loading could be increased by a factor of 1.35. Additionally, nonlinear time-history analysis for the target structure was performed to compare the seismic responses before and after applying the maximum allowable axial load. Based on the dynamic responses, the increased axial loads from green retrofits and/or vertical extensions could degrade structural performance and change its failure mode. The proposed methodology can rapidly estimate the allowable axial load range for existing reinforced concrete buildings without repeated modeling and computing processes. In addition, nonlinear time-history analysis is needed to accurately evaluate the impact of the increased axial loads from green retrofits/vertical extensions on structural performance. © 2024 by the authors.","allowable axial load range; existing buildings; green retrofit/vertical extension; reinforced concrete frame building; sustainability performance","building; estimation method; installation; machine learning; performance assessment; reinforced concrete; roof; seismic response; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200732664"

Often, phishers discuss these attack vectors in dark forums. Further, the probability of phishing attacks and the subsequent loss suffered by the firm are highly correlated. In this context, we propose a hybrid framework using explainable AI techniques to assess cyber-risks generated from correlated phishing attacks. The first phase computes the probability of expert phishers within a community of similar attackers with varying expertise. The second phase calculates the probability of phishing attacks upon a firm even after it has invested in IT security and adopted regulatory steps. The third phase categorises phishing and genuine URLs using various machine-learning-based classifiers. Next, it estimates the joint distribution of phishing attacks using an exponential-beta distribution and quantifies the expected loss using Archimedean Copula. Finally, we offer recommendations for firms through the computation of optimal investments in cyber-insurance versus IT security. First, based on the risk attitude of a firm, it can use this explainable-AI (XAI) framework to optimally invest in building security into its enterprise architecture and plan for cyber-risk mitigation strategies. Second, we identify a long-tail phenomenon demonstrated by the losses suffered during most cyber-attacks, which are not one-off incidents and are correlated.

While digital technologies make business processes efficient, they enable companies to make faster and more accurate decisions by automating daily and routine process tasks. Robotic process automation (RPA) automates routine and repetitive business processes, allowing many jobs performed by humans to be performed faster. This way, advantages such as reduced error rates, reduced costs, increased production speed, and labor productivity are provided. For the successful implementation of RPA, potential risks need to be considered. In this study, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) based on decomposed fuzzy sets (DFSs), a new extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, has been used to evaluate subjectiveness in expert judgments. Differing from the other extensions of fuzzy set theory, the advantage of DFSs is to simultaneously consider decision-makers’ optimistic and pessimistic answers. Thus, the answer given by the decision-maker to the positive and negative questions on the same subject defines the indeterminacy of the decision-maker, and the method takes this indeterminacy into account in the evaluation. This study assesses and evaluates the potential risks of six digital robots in process automation. Thirteen risks were individually assessed for each automated process. This study found “Sustainability challenge” critical in three processes, “Absence of governance management” in two, and “Security“ in one.

However, existing research has overlooked the impact of cold load pickup on system restoration efforts. A sudden load spike can lead to the overloading of generators and transformers, which can result in the failure of the system restoration process. This study leverages the topological flexibility through dynamic microgrid formation of the system to mitigate the impact of cold load pickup, thereby enhancing the efficiency of sequential load restoration. To alleviate the computational complexity arising from intricate operational constraints and the uncertainties inherent in cold load pickup conditions, this paper proposes a novel model-free framework. Unlike existing deep reinforcement learning models, we incorporate physical constraint information into the model by means of physics-informed neural networks, where the solution of an optimization problem is regarded as knowledge, enabling the agent to learn operational constraints more efficiently and stably. The proposed approach is compatible with and can be integrated into any deep reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes the advantage actor–critic framework with neural networks. This research employs the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm as a representative example for investigation. The effectiveness and generalization performance of the proposed method are validated on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder, while its scalability is assessed using the IEEE 8500-node test feeder system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Cold load pickup; Deep deterministic policy gradient; Dynamic microgrid formation; Physics-informed neural networks; Resilience enhancement","Reinforcement learning; Cold-load pickups; Deep deterministic policy gradient; Deterministics; Dynamic microgrid formation; Microgrid; Neural-networks; Physic-informed neural network; Policy gradient; Resilience enhancement; Restoration process; Deep reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206922836"

To mitigate the risk of bank failure amid financial crises, effective management of financial sustainability performance becomes paramount. This study introduces a comprehensive framework for the accurate and efficient quantification, indexing, and evaluation of financial sustainability within the American banking industry. Our approach begins by conceptualizing financial sustainability as a multi-stage, multifactor structure. We construct a composite index through a three-stage network data envelopment analysis (DEA) and subsequently develop a random forest classification model to predict financial sustainability outcomes. The classification model attains an average testing recall rate of 84.34 %. Additionally, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to scrutinize the impacts of contextual variables on financial sustainability performance across various substages and the overall banking process, as well as to improve the interpretability and transparency of the classification results. SHAP results reveal the significance and effects of contextual variables, and noteworthy differences in contextual impacts emerge among different banking substages. Specifically, loans and leases, interest income, total liabilities, total assets, and market capitalization positively contribute to the deposit stage; revenue to assets positively influences the loan stage; and revenue per share positively affects the profitability stage. This study serves the managerial objective of assisting banks in capturing financial sustainability and identifying potential sources of unsustainability. By unveiling the “black box” of financial sustainability and deciphering its internal dynamics and interactions, banks can enhance their ability to monitor and control financial sustainability performance more effectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Data envelopment analysis; Machine learning; Performance evaluation; Random forest; SHAP","Data envelopment analysis; Classification models; Contextual variables; Data envelopment; Financial sustainability; Machine-learning; Performances evaluation; Random forests; Shapley; Shapley additive explanation; Sustainability performance; Decentralized finance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205243823"

The SS model was applied for forecasting the future RUL values depending on the measured values by the ANFIS-HGWO. The overall results confirm the outperforming of the ANFIS-HWGO-SS compared to different contributions available in the literature using the PRONOSTIA database in terms of performance measure, Therefore, the ANFIS-HWGO-SS approach is a reliable tool for determining the RUL before any unexpected breakdown and further supports the decision-making by offering a vital timeframe for making the proper action before a failure occurs which can be applied for other machine-related tasks to ensure stability by decreasing the failure of the machine, reliability of the RM by providing HQP, security by avoiding accidents in MI, marking a significant step towards enhanced operational efficiency and sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS); Decision Tree (DT); Hybrid Whale Grey Wolf Optimizer (HWGO); Remaining Useful Life (RUL); State Space (SS)","Fracture mechanics; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Quality control; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Decision tree; Gray wolves; Hybrid whale gray wolf optimizer; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Optimizers; Remaining useful life; Remaining useful lives; State space; State-space; Ball bearings","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212962347"

Their safe storage in dry casks is critical for nuclear waste management. However, interim storage or transportation of a canister in a cask, the FAs may be damaged due to human errors, extreme events, or long-term degradation. Therefore, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods are needed to monitor their structural integrity over time. In this paper, a novel machine learning (ML)-aided method is proposed to identify different levels of FA damage using measurements taken on the exterior surface of a 2/3-scale experimental canister mock-up. The frequency response functions (FRFs) of the fully loaded canister basket (FLCB) system and the canister with interior damage were computed from recorded input excitation and acceleration response measurements. Machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), were trained and tested using features extracted from the FRF difference between an intact FLCB and a damaged canister. The results indicated that the RF model produces the best performance with a testing accuracy of 0.916 and Macro-F1 score of 0.920. Notably, the RF model accurately predicted the damage levels regardless of sensor (i.e., accelerometer) locations. The GNB, however, provided a compromised performance due to its inability to handle correlated features and non-ideal Gaussian distribution of the data. The ANN model exhibited an intermediate performance between the RF and GNB models. Besides, ANN and GNB models had a higher rate of false negatives than the RF models. The accuracy of the model needs to be considered in a real-life implementation because false positives are likely to result in added costs in terms of further inspection while false negatives could potentially result in further degradation and failure. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Damage detection; Dry storage canister; Machine learning (ML); Non-destructive evaluation (NDE); Spent nuclear fuel (SNF)","Damage detection; Digital storage; Forestry; Frequency response; Fuel storage; Neural networks; Nondestructive examination; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Radioactive wastes; Waste management; Dry storage; Dry storage canister; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Non destructive evaluation; Non-destructive evaluation; Random forest modeling; Spend nuclear fuel; Spent nuclear fuels; Storage canister; Machine learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177565546"

Despite their potential, these networks often experience payment failures due to delays in pathfinding, unreliable routes and infrastructure issues, resulting in excessive carbon emissions. Current reinforcement learning solutions for payment channel networks mainly address issues like payment channel balance and routing fees but often overlook the infrastructure-related causes of payment failure. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning-based architecture that combines reinforcement learning agent with native deterministic pathfinding algorithms. This hybrid approach leverages the fast, complete solutions of deterministic algorithms while adapting to the network's dynamic and probabilistic nature of payments to significantly enhance payment success rates.

However, the lack of real-time information sharing during HMWS implementation and operation, coupled with uncertainties stemming from human instability and the complexities introduced by smart networking environments in the context of I4.0, poses challenges to the synchronous coordination of this distributed human-centric manufacturing system. Failure in synchronization not only compromises overall system integrity, leading to unrealistic decision-making and potential harm to human health but also goes against the principles of Industry 5.0 (I5.0), which proposes placing human well-being at the center of the production process for human-centric smart manufacturing in the future. In this context, this research presents real-time data-driven hyper objects orchestrating for the human-machine synchronization (RHYTHMS) based on a service-oriented human-to-machine architecture (SOH2M) and a model reference adaptive fuzzy control for real-time information sharing and synchronous coordination of the smart HMWS.

Previous studies have primarily focused on modeling or predicting failures in medical devices, mostly examining internal (endogenous) factors that impact device performance and the development of optimal service strategies. However, a comprehensive investigation of external (exogenous) factors has been notably absent. This research introduced a novel hierarchical risk management framework designed to accommodate a broad array of healthcare technologies, not limited to just medical devices. It significantly advanced the field by thoroughly investigating and validating a comprehensive set of 53 risk factors and assessed their influence on HTM. Additionally, this study embraced the perspective of enterprise risk management (ERM) and expanded it to identify and incorporate a wider range of risk factors, offering a more holistic and strategic approach to risk assessment in healthcare technology management. The findings revealed that several previously underexplored external and internal factors significantly impacted HTM performance. Notably, the Fuzzy AHP survey identified “design risk” under facility and environmental risks as the highest risk for HTM in this region. Furthermore, this study revealed that three out of the top ten risks were related to “facility and internal environmental” factors, six were related to technological endogenous factors, and only one was related to managerial factors. This distribution underscores the critical areas for intervention and the need for robust facility and technology management strategies. In conclusion, this research not only fills a critical void by providing a robust framework for healthcare technology risk assessment but also broadens the scope of risk analysis to include a wider array of technologies, thereby enhancing the efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions in the region. Additionally, the proposed hierarchy provides insights into the underlying risk factors for healthcare technology management, with potential applications extending beyond the regional context to a global scale. Moreover, the equation we proposed offers a novel perspective on the key risk factors involved in healthcare technology management, presenting insights with far-reaching implications applicable not only regionally but also on a global level. This framework also supports sustainability goals by encouraging the efficient and responsible utilization and management of healthcare technologies, essential for ensuring the long-term economic and environmental sustainability of medical technology use. This research is of an exploratory nature, with the findings from the Fuzzy AHP analysis being most applicable to the specific geographic regions examined. Additional research is required to validate these results and to confirm the trends observed in various other regions and contexts. © 2024 by the authors.","analytic hierarchy process (AHP); blue print; comparison matrix; endogenous risk factor; enterprise risk management; exogenous risk factors; facility management; healthcare risk management (HRM); healthcare system; healthcare technology management (HTM); healthcare technology risk management (HTRM); PESTLE; regulatory compliance; sustainability","Saudi Arabia; analytical hierarchy process; comparative study; compliance; environmental factor; fuzzy mathematics; health care; performance assessment; regulatory approach; risk assessment; risk factor; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205221030"

Most current credit risk survival models use an underlying linear model. This is beneficial in terms of interpretability but is restrictive for real-life applications since it cannot discover hidden nonlinearities and interactions within the data. This study uses discrete-time survival models with embedded neural networks as estimators of time to default. This provides flexibility to express nonlinearities and interactions between variables and hence allows for models with better overall model fit. Additionally, the neural networks are used to estimate age–period–cohort (APC) models so that default risk can be decomposed into time components for loan age (maturity), origination (vintage), and environment (e.g., economic, operational, and social effects). These can be built as general models or as local APC models for specific customer segments. The local APC models reveal special conditions for different customer groups. The corresponding APC identification problem is solved by a combination of regularization and fitting the decomposed environment time risk component to macroeconomic data since the environmental risk is expected to have a strong relationship with macroeconomic conditions. Our approach is shown to be effective when tested on a large publicly available US mortgage dataset. This novel framework can be adapted by practitioners in the financial industry to improve modeling, estimation, and assessment of credit risk. © 2024 by the authors.","age–period–cohort; credit risk; neural network; survival model","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185969743"

Supply chain disruption influences a series of problems, including transportation delays, delivery times slow down and cost increases, etc. Additionally, resilience strategies mitigate and enable a supply chain to respond to disruption while recovering or improving so that risks are reduced, and operations are more efficient. However, previous studies have failed to identify supply chain disruption indicators, construct a hierarchical framework with causal interrelationships among the attributes, and develop resilience strategies to handle disruption situations, especially in the garment industry. This study proposes the creation of 6 aspects and 18 criteria of supply chain disruption and resilience strategy attributes via the fuzzy Delphi method and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. The findings show that the causal group consists of supply risk, flexible business strategies and collaborative strategies, whereas the effect group consists of human issues, transportation failure and preventive resilience strategies. In practice, managers should focus on resilience strategies such as backup suppliers, risk and revenue sharing, risk management culture, partnership management, and cooperation with stakeholders to enhance supply chain disruption.

The primary transformation was the conversion of marshes into lakes (18.05 km2) and reservoirs/ponds (17.98 km2). Approximately 0.06 km2 of lakes were transformed into canals/channels. (3) River patches have the largest area, while canals/channels have the smallest. The patch density (PD) and landscape shape index (LSI) of wetlands fluctuate significantly, and the reduction in area leads to a 3.46% decrease in aggregation index (AI). Shannon’s diversity index (SHDI) has decreased by 5.41%. (4) The centroid of marshes experiences significant changes, while river changes are complex. The centroid changes in reservoirs/ponds are located along the southeast–northwest line. Canals/watercourses remain stable. Lakes exhibit the longest migration. This study provides robust scientific support for wetland ecological protection, policy formulation, and social sustainable development by conducting an in-depth analysis of the dynamic change characteristics of wetlands in the Weihe River Basin. © 2025 by the authors.","centroid change; landscape pattern; Weihe River wetland; wetland resources","China; Wei Basin; agglomeration; carbon sink; dynamic analysis; environmental protection; extreme event; landscape; spatial distribution; wetland","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216115594"

High-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence techniques are crucial in this application. Risk mitigation and coastal management must design scientific workflow appropriately and maintain them continuously updated and operational. Climate change accelerating increase trend of the past decades impacted on sea-level rise, together with broader factors such as geostatic effects and subsidence, reducing the effectiveness of coastal defenses. Due to this, the support tools, such as Early Warning Systems, have become increasingly more valuable because they can process data promptly and provide valuable indications for mitigation proposals. We developed the Shoreline Alert Model (SAM), an operational Python tool that produces simulation scenarios, ‘what-if’ assumptions, and coastal flooding forecasts to fill this gap in our study area. SAM aims to provide decision-makers, scientists, and engineers with new tools to help forecast significant weather-marine events and support related management or emergency responses. SAM aims to fill the gap between the wind-driven wave models, which produce simulations and forecasts of waves of significant height, period, and direction in deep or mid-water, and the run-up local models, which exstimulate marine ingression in the event of intense weather phenomena. It employs a parallelization scheme that allows users to run it on heterogeneous parallel architectures. It produced results approximately 24 times faster than the baseline when using shared memory with distributed memory, processing roughly 20,000 coastal cross-shore profiles along the coastline of the Campania region (Italy). Increasing the performance of this model and, at the same time, honoring the need for relatively modest HPC resources will enable the local manager and policymakers to enforce fast and effective responses to intense weather phenomena. © The Author(s) 2024.","Coastal flooding; Hierarchical distributed computation; Marine ingression; Parallel environmental modeling","Climate change; Computer software; Decision making; Floods; Memory architecture; Python; Sea level; Weather forecasting; Coastal flooding; Distributed computations; Distributed models; Environmental model; Event simulation; Hierarchical distributed computation; Marine ingression; Parallel environmental modeling; Performance; Weather phenomena; Parallel architectures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197432055"

Additionally, this approach uniquely integrates energy consumption into the scheme, addressing both performance and sustainability concerns.

Complex aviation systems’ integrity deteriorates over time due to operational factors; hence, the ability to forecast component remaining useful life (RUL) is vital to their optimal operation. Data-driven prognostic models are essential for system RUL prediction. These models benefit run-to-failure datasets the most. Thus, significant factors that could affect systematic integrity must be examined to quantify the operational component of RUL. To expand predictive approaches, the authors of this research developed a novel method for calculating the RUL of a group of aircraft engines using the N-CMAPSS dataset, which provides simulated degradation trajectories under real flight conditions. They offered bootstrap trees and hyperbolic tangent NtanH(3)Boost(20) neural networks as prognostic alternatives. The hyperbolic tangent boosted neural network uses damage propagation modelling based on earlier research and adds two accuracy levels. The suggested neural network architecture activates with the hyperbolic tangent function. This extension links the deterioration process to its operating history, improving degradation modelling. During validation, models accurately predicted observed flight cycles with 95–97% accuracy. We can use this work to combine prognostic approaches to extend the lifespan of critical aircraft systems and assist maintenance approaches in reducing operational and environmental hazards, all while maintaining normal operation. The proposed methodology yields promising results, making it suitable for adoption due to its relevance to prognostic difficulties. © 2024 by the authors.","aircraft systems; bootstrap forest; neural network; prognostic and health management; remaining useful life","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197262245"

Micro-grids, in particular, have gained significant traction in the energy market for their reliability and sustainability benefits in distributed systems. However, grid-interactive systems are often subjected to disturbances caused by system-level faults and external factors. Both symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults, especially under harsh environmental conditions, can lead to equipment failures and even complete system blackouts. To enhance reliability and efficiency, hybrid renewable energy systems have emerged as optimal solutions for sustainable energy production. The rising use of power electronic converters in industrial and household applications, however, introduces severe power quality issues. This paper analyzes the dynamic performance of a micro-grid system comprising solar Photovoltaic (PV) and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technologies under symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault conditions. Here, voltage compensation is achieved using the dqo algorithm. To mitigate harmonic distortions, a custom power device with an intelligent controller is considered more efficient and cost-effective. In the proposed hybrid micro-grid, a fuzzy controlled dynamic voltage restorer (FC-DVR) is employed for harmonic mitigation, implemented through a pulse width modulation (PWM) generator using MATLAB/Simulink models. The effectiveness of the FC-DVR on power quality improvement is assessed based on total harmonic distortion (THD). Simulation results under various fault conditions, such as line to ground (LG), line to line (LL), double line to ground (LLG), and three-phase (LLL), demonstrate that while a conventional dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) reduces THD by up to 26%, the FC-DVR achieves a reduction of up to 51%. This highlights the FC-DVR's ability to mitigate voltage harmonics and significantly enhance power quality. The FC-DVR has been demonstrated to be an effective controller for mitigating harmonics in hybrid micro-grid environments. © 2024 Mohamed Iqbal M et al.","Clean energy; Fuzzy controlled dynamic voltage restorer; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Micro-grids; Power quality improvement; Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical faults","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211366359"

An effective risk assessment and early-warning tool will significantly assist system operators in monitoring and controlling power systems. However, existing methods mainly rely on simplified analytical conditional probability models to describe the component failure probability under different operating conditions and are not suitable for low-probability risk assessment. Inspired by the idea of Bayesian statistics, a Bayesian deep learning-based probabilistic risk assessment and early-warning model considering meteorological conditions is proposed in this article. A new Bayesian neural network (BNN) is proposed which efficiently utilizes expert experience and domain knowledge as prior to model the contingency probability. And a hybrid neural network is developed to rationally utilize the multisource heterogeneous data and comprehensively analyze the historical and forecast information. Finally, a novel risk assessment and early-warning model for high-impact, low-probability extreme events is proposed, which can predict the risk for the next n time-steps.

Recent proof-of-concept demonstrates that ESNN can learn complex nonlinear dynamics from clean data generated by closed ‘toy’ models with known state-space dynamics. However, in modeling open real-world biophysical systems like the soil, we do not directly observe state space dynamics, and consequently must infer them from noisy data. We addressed these challenges by preprocessing data inputted into ESNN with methods from empirical nonlinear dynamics to filter noise, test for stationarity, and reconstruct state-space dynamics from denoised data. This promotes the dynamic efficiency of ESNN since it learns complex dynamics of stationary real-world dynamic systems from denoised data. We worked with two sensor records representing different irrigation practices collected in field trials in southern Florida. We reconstructed low-dimensional nonlinear-deterministic dynamics in both records providing empirical evidence that irregular sawtooth cycling due to complex wetting/drying events is not aberrational but intrinsic to the real-world soil moisture systems generating these records. We employed the UF-NVIDIA-GPU infrastructure to uniformly sample a large grid of ESNN hyper-parameters, and successfully screened for architectures skillfully reproducing state space dynamics reconstructed from sensor records. Skillful architectures served as digital twins to forecast soil moisture levels preserving lower- and higher frequency oscillations characterizing both sensor records, and to differentiate between recurring and sporadic extreme soil moisture events. This distinction fine-tunes irrigation planning by forecasting recurrent extreme events to the day. Operationalizing ESNN for real biophysical data has broader impacts in addressing pressing environmental challenges involving nonlinear biophysical processes and creating AI-based early-warning systems forecasting extreme environmental events (flooding, drought, landslides, fires). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Echo state neural networks; Empirical nonlinear dynamics; Sensor records; Soil moisture","Florida [United States]; United States; Complex networks; Dynamics; Forecasting; Irrigation; Moisture control; Moisture determination; Moisture meters; Network architecture; Soil surveys; Complex soils; Echo state neural networks; Empirical nonlinear dynamic; Learn+; Moisture level; Real-world; Sensor record; Soil moisture dynamics; Space dynamics; State-space; artificial neural network; early warning system; irrigation system; landslide; sensor; soil moisture; Soil moisture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193201357"

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been constructed to facilitate wastewater treatment to safeguard public health, enhance economic development, protect the natural environment, and increase the quality of life. These plants are required to operate continuously to meet stringent effluent requirements at the lowest operational cost. This paper presents the design of intelligent computational hybrid control schemes for the improvement of operational cost (OCI) and effluent quality (EQI) reduction at a WWTP. Two control strategies have been designed on the basis of artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic control (FLC), genetic algorithms (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a minimal number of measurements. These strategies are used to optimize the aeration intensity by optimizing the dynamics of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the last aerated reactor according to the availability of ammonia nitrogen. The proposed control strategies are implemented, evaluated, and validated on the benchmark simulation model no. 1 (BSM1), an internationally well-known open access platform for benchmarking control strategies for WWTPs. Simulation experiments indicate that the proposed intelligent control schemes significantly improve the EQI and reduce the OCI simultaneously in dry, rain, and storm weather conditions, with no effluent violation cases recorded. The major findings revealed that, 12.38% of the EQI has been improved and 20.02% of the OCI has been reduced during storm weather conditions when compared to the default control scheme (DCS). This significantly contributes in enhancing the achievement of sustainability in WWTPs.

This study looks into the effective dynamic integration of wind turbines and photovoltaic (PV) systems to drive an induction motor (IM) under varying environmental conditions. Results show that the integrated system's power output grows in direct proportion to the intensity of solar radiation and wind speed, which enables the IM to operate more efficiently and accelerate. The study's cutting-edge control systems, in particular, operate very well by utilising sliding mode control (SMC) to keep the rotor flux within safe operating limits, hence avoiding magnetic saturation and possible motor failures. The study also emphasises how well the reference speed adjustment (RSA) system works to stabilise the DC link voltage with fuzzy logic approaches, guaranteeing that the IM's generated power is used as efficiently as possible while avoiding undesired fluctuations.

However, Li-ion batteries exhibit complex performance degradation behaviors, typically in a combination of nonlinear gradual degradation with time-varying deterioration rates and abrupt performance changes (e.g., sudden capacity drops or regenerations), posing significant challenges to accurate and reliable degradation tracking and prediction. This study tackles this challenge from two perspectives: an advanced stochastic model to describe complex degradation patterns and a generalizable Bayesian inference neural network for efficient parametric estimation of the stochastic model. Specifically, the stochastic model employs a rational polynomial term for tracking gradual battery degradation and a compound Poisson process term for capturing abrupt capacity changes. To estimate the model parameters related to degradation rates and scaling, a novel Conditional Invertible Neural Network (CINN) architecture is investigated. CINN can comprehensively evaluate the degradation likelihood (i.e., dependencies of capability observations on various battery degradation patterns) by leveraging extensive simulation data during the training phase, and then through its unique inverse calculation capability, efficiently and probabilistically estimate the posterior density of model parameters conditional on capacity observations in the real-world applications. The effectiveness of the proposed stochastic model and parametric estimation method, in terms of accuracy and generalizability, has been evaluated using simulation data and run-to-failure tests provided in NASA's lithium-ion battery dataset. Experimental studies and comparisons reveal that the CINN-based parametric estimation substantially outperforms two commonly adopted Bayesian inference methods, Particle Filtering (PF)-based step-by-step estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based batch estimation, on both accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Battery health prognosis; Bayesian inference; Conditional invertible neural network; Parametric estimation","Bayesian networks; Complex networks; Computational efficiency; Degradation; Deterioration; Inference engines; Inverse problems; Ions; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Statistical tests; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Battery health; Battery health prognose; Bayesian inference; Conditional invertible neural network; Degradation patterns; Health prognosis; Neural-networks; Parametric estimation; Performance degradation; Stochastic-modeling; Lithium-ion batteries","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190298672"

We aimed to design a ML-driven CDS tool to predict opioid overdose risk and gather feedback for its integration into the University of Florida Health (UFHealth) electronic health record (EHR) system. Methods: We used user-centered design methods to integrate the ML algorithm into the EHR system. The backend and UI design sub-teams collaborated closely, both informed by user feedback sessions. We conducted seven user feedback sessions with five UF Health primary care physicians (PCPs) to explore aspects of CDS tools, including workflow, risk display, and risk mitigation strategies. After customizing the tool based on PCPs’ feedback, we held two rounds of one-on-one usability testing sessions with 8 additional PCPs to gather feedback on prototype alerts. These sessions informed iterative UI design and backend processes, including alert frequency and reappearance circumstances. Results: The backend process development identified needs and requirements from our team, information technology, UFHealth, and PCPs. Thirteen PCPs (male = 62%, White = 85%) participated across 7 user feedback sessions and 8 usability testing sessions. During the user feedback sessions, PCPs (n = 5) identified flaws such as the term “high risk” of overdose potentially leading to unintended consequences (e.g., immediate addiction services referrals), offered suggestions, and expressed trust in the tool. In the first usability testing session, PCPs (n = 4) emphasized the need for natural risk presentation (e.g., 1 in 200) and suggested displaying the alert multiple times yearly for at-risk patients. Another 4 PCPs in the second usability testing session valued the UFHealth-specific alert for managing new or unfamiliar patients, expressed concerns about PCPs’ workload when prescribing to high-risk patients, and recommended incorporating the details page into training sessions to enhance usability. Conclusions: The final backend process for our CDS alert aligns with PCP needs and UFHealth standards. Integrating feedback from PCPs in the early development phase of our ML-driven CDS tool helped identify barriers and facilitators in the CDS integration process. This collaborative approach yielded a refined prototype aimed at minimizing unintended consequences and enhancing usability. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.","Clinical decision support; Machine learning; User-centered design approach","Arthroplasty; Electroencephalography; Electronic health record; Electrotherapeutics; Endocrinology; Fracture fixation; mHealth; Noninvasive medical procedures; Occupational diseases; Personnel training; Records management; Usability engineering; Clinical decision support; Electronic health; Machine-learning; Primary care; Support tool; Testing sessions; University of Florida; Usability testing; User feedback; User-centered design approaches; User centered design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206600587"

Before providing our perspective on why the research papers included into the SI are of great relevance, we give a brief and personal overview of recent directions in financial stability research in general, esp., related to topics accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic or post-pandemic economic and financial conditions and their complexity. Papers published in the SI cover four topics of research in the financial stability field, featuring some outstanding and innovative projects presented during the conference. The first topic is on interconnectedness and shock transmission in the financial system, diving deep into asset fire sales, interconnectedness of various segments of the financial system, in addition to banks, on the optimality of systemic risk capital buffers, and on how risks are priced in the interbank market network. The second one touches upon climate change risks looking at investors’ reactions to international climate policy developments, in particular on the Paris Agreement front and how to jointly model physical and transition risk in the banking system, including the important concept of double materiality. The third topic is represented by projects focused on policy analysis for systemic risk mitigation, specifically dealing with macroprudential policy instruments and crisis mitigation policies. Finally, research papers in the last topic on big data and market data focus on the innovative ways to explore the growing body of data sources, such as data collected by regulators, including credit register data, supervisory data and market data on financial transactions, to better understand sources and implications of systemic risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Complex system; Financial stability; Systemic risk","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184219970"

Therefore, monitoring bearing failures in production equipment is important for improving supply chain sustainability. Due to the generalization limitations of neural network models, specific models must be trained for specific tasks. However, in real industrial scenarios, there is a severe lack of labeled samples, making it difficult to deploy fault diagnosis models across massive amounts of equipment in workshops. In order to solve the above issue, this paper proposes a cloud-edge-end collaborative semi-supervised learning framework, which provides multi-level computing power and data support for building a foundation model. A data augmentation method based on the bearing fault mechanism is proposed, which effectively preserves the inherent essential characteristics in vibration signals by normalizing frequency and adding noise in specific frequency bands. A novel contrastive learning model is designed, which narrows the distances between positive samples and widens the distances between negative samples in the high-dimensional space through cross comparisons in the time dimension and knowledge dimension, thereby extracting the most essential characteristics from the unlabeled signals. Multiple sets of experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an approximately 98% fault classification accuracy with only 1.2% labeled samples. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud-edge-end collaboration; Contrastive learning; Fault diagnosis; Foundation model; Semi-supervised learning","Classification (of information); Domain Knowledge; Fault detection; Machine learning; Supply chains; Bearing failures; Bearing fault diagnosis; Cloud-edge-end collaboration; Contrastive learning; Domain knowledge; Essential characteristic; Faults diagnosis; Foundation models; Production equipments; Semi-supervised learning; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197794826"

In this study, PM2.5 inside and outside a typical tunnel-ventilated layer house were collected, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) were used for rapidly detection and risk assessment of PM2.5-bound metals, including aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), strontium (Sr), cadmium (Cd), barium (Ba) and lead (Pb). The carbon fingerprint peak ratio (CFPR) correction was proposed for reducing the matrix effect of PM2.5 generated from different sources. Machine learning models were built for quantitative analysis of PM2.5 concentration and the relative content (w/w) of metals in PM2.5. The optimal CFPR-LIBS-based models performed well with R2psample over 0.94. The PM2.5-bound metal concentrations in air (w/v) were then determined, and the NRMSE for 12 elements were 0.0402 ∼ 0.1397. The environmental and health risks associated with PM2.5−bound metals at the layer house were assessed and visualized utilizing LIBS, and the high-risk areas were identified. The results indicated that though heavy metals in feed and manure were under safety threshold, Cu, Pb, Cd, Mn, Cr and As were found to be bound by PM2.5 with high enrichment degree and have potential health or environmental risks, and the feed formulations and management policy should be improved. The proposed rapid analysis, risk assessment and mapping method using LIBS could greatly improve the timeliness of PM2.5 detection and air quality assessment in poultry houses, providing valuable reference for breeders to achieve efficient and green egg production. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>); Heavy metal; Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Laying hen house; Risk assessment","China; Barium compounds; Clinical research; Computer control; Copper; Diagnosis; Endocrinology; Explosives detection; Failure analysis; Fault tolerance; Heavy metals; Iron; Manganese; Medical problems; Model predictive control; Near infrared spectroscopy; Negative bias temperature instability; Neurology; Oncology; Optical emission spectroscopy; Optical pumping; Orthopedics; Outages; Pathology; Patient treatment; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Pulse repetition rate; Reliability analysis; Reliability theory; Software reliability; Statistical process control; Zinc; Bound metals; Egg production; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy; Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Laying hen house; Laying hens; PM 2.5; Risks assessments; air quality; atmospheric pollution; egg production; heavy metal; particulate matter; poultry; risk assessment; Air quality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216499813"

While ESG ratings are widely used to assess a company's non-financial performance, the impact of these factors on financial stability and systemic risk is still under debate. By extending the Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) method with a double regularization on both the underlying vector autoregressive (VAR) parameters and the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals, we are able to address the curse of dimensionality within each estimation. This allows us to examine how vulnerable a company is and how much systemic impact a company has given its specific ESG. Looking at a larger sample of European stocks over the period 2007–2022, we empirically show that both the best and worst ESG performers have the largest impact on the financial system in normal times. However, during a crisis, companies with the best ESG ratings generate significant spillovers throughout the system. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating ESG factors into systemic risk assessments and monitoring companies’ ESG performance to ensure financial stability. Policymakers can benefit from this research by supporting investment in high ESG companies to mitigate relevant spillovers during stressed market conditions, when such companies are more interconnected. © 2024 The Author(s)","ESG; Financial stability; Network analysis; Sustainability; Systemic risks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185441089"

Here, we fill this gap by introducing the Operational-Affected-Dismantled (OAD) model that captures both local and nonlocal failure propagation mechanisms. The model combines reaction–diffusion processes for local spreading with a global field effect for long-range interactions, allowing us to quantitatively characterize the cascade dynamics in infrastructure networks. Moreover, we include information on external stressors to assess the robustness of empirical network infrastructures and build spatial risk maps. By using data from severe storms (2009–2016) and from earthquakes (2000–2023) as stressors of the North American power grid and the worldwide airline transportation system, respectively, we offer a quantitative way to rank events by their potential to trigger systemic effects. By analyzing the response of the European power grid to simulated severe storms, we find that it can show high levels of systemic risk. Uncertainty in global climate and the accelerating frequency of extreme events all over the globe call for novel strategies to quantify, adapt to and mitigate systemic risk. Our framework provides a suitable starting point to assess the robustness of empirical systems in realistic and what-if scenarios. © 2024 The Authors","Complex networks; Complex systems; Phase transition; Risk map","Air transportation; Artificial intelligence; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Cascading failures; Catastrophic event; Exposed to; Infrastructure networks; Internal failure; Localised; Physical quantities; Risk maps; Severe storms; Systemic risks; Large scale systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210384007"

The findings suggest that government digital regulation impedes enterprise fintech innovation, as it heightens the overall external environmental risks and increases internal operational burdens for enterprises. Heterogeneity analysis shows that this inhibitory effect is more pronounced in private enterprises, firms with stronger financial stability, and high-tech companies. Furthermore, significant differences exist across various dimensions of digital regulation and fintech innovation.

These enterprises address social exclusion and community development within complex institutional environments. Despite increasing governmental support, CBSEs struggle with historical inequalities, resource limitations, high poverty levels, inadequate infrastructure, and complex social dynamics. These challenges contribute to a high failure rate among SMMEs, including CBSEs, which represent approximately 71% of community-level businesses. This study examines how complex system dynamics in marginalized South African suburbs impact the sustainable leadership and resilience of CBSEs. Utilizing a qualitative approach, the study conducted 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews with CBSE leaders. The findings revealed that effective leadership in CBSEs requires extraordinary abilities to traverse complexity, adapt to changes, and engage in dynamic organizational change. The key themes identified included adaptive and flexible leadership, interdependencies and network collaboration, community engagement and co-creation, continuous learning and feedback loops, policy influence and response, and resource utilization and constraints. By applying complex systems leadership theory (CSLT) and sustainable leadership principles, the research offers insights into the mechanisms enabling CBSEs to thrive in challenging environments. These findings contribute to Social Enterprise Management and Leadership Studies, providing practical implications for policymakers and practitioners to support CBSE development and sustainability in marginalized urban communities. © 2024 by the authors.","community-based social enterprises; complex system dynamics; marginalized suburbs; resilience; sustainable leadership","Gauteng; South Africa; Soweto; community development; leadership; machine learning; marginalization; poverty; social exclusion; suburban area; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206590535"

Neural networks can naturally incorporate additional structure in the data. We develop a recurrent version of EQRN that is able to capture complex sequential dependence in time series. We apply this method to forecast flood risk in the Swiss Aare catchment. It exploits information from multiple covariates in space and time to provide one-day-ahead predictions of return levels and exceedance probabilities. This output complements the static return level from a traditional extreme value analysis, and the predictions are able to adapt to distributional shifts as experienced in a changing climate.

Forecasts are subject to the systemic uncertainty of human systems, considerable event-driven uncertainty, and show biases towards optimistic growth paths. The purpose of this study is to consider approaches to improve economic foresight. Design/methodology/approach: This study describes the practice of economic foresight as evolving in two separate, non-overlapping branches, short-term economic forecasting, and long-term scenario analysis of development, the latter found in studies of climate change and sustainability. The unique case of Ireland is considered, a country that has experienced both steep growth and deep troughs, with uncertainty that has confounded forecasting. The challenges facing forecasts are discussed, with brief review of the drivers of growth, and of long-term economic scenarios in the global literature. Findings: Economic forecasting seeks to manage uncertainty by improving the accuracy of quantitative point forecasts, and related models. Yet, systematic forecast failures remain, and the economy defies prediction, even in the near-term. In contrast, long-term scenario analysis eschews forecasts in favour of a set of plausible or possible alternative scenarios. Using alternative scenarios is a response to the irreducible uncertainty of complex systems, with sophisticated approaches employed to integrate qualitative and quantitative insights. Research limitations/implications: To support economic and fiscal policymaking, it is necessary support advancement in approaches to economic foresight, to improve handling of uncertainty and related risk. Practical implications: While European Union Regulation (EC) 1466/97 mandates pursuit of improved accuracy, in short-term economic forecasts, there is now a case for implementing advanced foresight approaches, for improved analysis, and more robust decision-making. Social implications: Building economic resilience and adaptability, as part of a sustainable future, requires both long-term strategic planning, and short-term policy. A 21st century policymaking process can be better supported by analysis of alternative scenarios. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the article is original in considering the application of scenario foresight approaches, in economic forecasting. The study has value in improving the baseline forecast methods, that are fundamental to contemporary economics, and in bringing the field of economics into the heart of foresight. © 2023, Tadhg O’Mahony, Jyrki Luukkanen, Jarmo Vehmas and Jari Roy Lee Kaivo-oja.","Economy; Forecasting; Foresight; Public policy; Scenarios; Uncertainty","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161370944"

In specific, providing timely restoration plans for interdependent infrastructures facing disruptions has been a challenge for decision makers. In this study, we focus on geospatial (co-location) and functional interdependencies to capture the impact of cascading failures on infrastructure systems. The dynamics of real networks are more complicated to be captured by one objective function. Therefore, we define three objective functions in three pillars of sustainability: (a) economic, (b) social, and (c) environmental. To solve the multiobjective optimization model, we develop a learn-to-decompose framework, consisting of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition module and a Gaussian process regression (GPR) module to periodically learn from the obtained Pareto front and guide the search direction. We also included a heuristic module to address two significant challenges in restoring interdependent infrastructures: the island scenario and co-location interdependencies. We applied the proposed framework to benchmark problems and interdependent water and transportation networks in the City of Tampa, FL. We carried out sensitivity analyses to monitor the performance of the GPR by different kernel functions. We also provided insights for decision makers by finding the trade-off between fortification (proactive) and restoration (reactive) costs. The result demonstrates the proposed framework is feasible and applicable for large-scale networks. © 2022 The Authors.

However, taking these actions create some operational costs. Thus, it is appropriate for rising nations to prioritize sustainable development objectives. Due to this condition, more critical sustainable development goals should be identified. Accordingly, this study evaluates green energy-oriented sustainable development goals for emerging economies. Within this context, a model is generated by considering the golden cut and bipolar q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs). The novelty of this study is to identify key green energy-oriented sustainable development goals for the improvement of emerging economies by an original model based on the golden cut and bipolar q-ROF decision making approach. All results are similar, indicating the proposed model's validity and coherency. It is concluded that increasing renewable energy is the most significant target with a weight of 0.235 regarding green energy-oriented sustainable development. Cooperation and efficiency are other significant issues for this condition, with weights of 0.198 and 0.196. It is also identified that Turkey and Mexico are the most successful countries in reaching green energy-oriented sustainable development goals. Increasing the share of renewable energy in total energy production and consumption is important for emerging countries. For this situation, governments should provide subsidies for renewable energy investors to provide a cost advantage. In this context, issues such as tax cuts and loans with low-interest rates can increase the motivation of clean energy investors. © 2024 The Authors","fuzzy decision making; Green energy; sustainability; sustainable development goals","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202913101"

During its operation, a minor imbalance or flaw in turbocharger rotors could lead to the system catastrophic failures. The two floating ring bearings that support a turbocharger allow it to operate at high speeds. The exhaust gases impacting the turbine and the inlet air impacting the compressor cause axial forces in the turbine, resulting in axial displacements. To balance these two components of axial forces, a thrust bearing is used in the turbocharger. The present work focuses on the comparative study of the turbocharger with and without the thrust bearing. The thrust bearing's pressure distribution is first calculated, and the nonlinear bearing forces acting on the turbocharger rotor are obtained. The exhaust gas forces are considered radial direction excitations, while blade passing excitations are taken as axial forces. The critical speeds of the rotor are first estimated using the Campbel diagram. An experimental study on an automobile turbocharger rotor is performed to validate the frequencies obtained from the present finite element model. Further, the system stability with and without thrust bearings at different operating speeds is illustrated. The influence of the thrust bearing location and preload is investigated on the system response. It is found that the thrust bearing has a significant effect on the system stability at higher speeds. The system stability condition at different operating conditions is identified by the trained neural network models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering 2024.","Automotive turbocharger; Dynamic analysis; Finite element method; Floating ring bearings; Thrust bearing","Axial flow; Axial flow turbomachinery; Carbon footprint; Finite element method; Machine learning; System stability; Thrust bearings; Automotive turbochargers; Axial forces; Comparison analysis; Dynamics analysis; Floating ring bearings; High Speed; High-speed turbochargers; Rotor systems; System's stabilities; Turbocharger rotors; Superchargers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191746307"

Despite government efforts to support rice farmers, challenges, such as production failures and profit losses, remain prevalent. This study evaluates the quality of government services provided to rice farmers through a service quality-based framework (SERVQUAL), assessing five key dimensions: assurance (AS), empathy (EM), reliability (RL), responsiveness (RS), and tangibility (TA). Structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed to examine the relationships among these service quality dimensions and other latent variables, including service quality (SQ), farmers’ satisfaction (FS), farmers’ trust (FT), perceived security (PS), and perceived effectiveness (PE). Data were gathered from 400 respondents using a 55-item survey. The findings indicate that perceived security (PS) is the most critical factor in enhancing the overall quality of government services. The study emphasizes the importance of adopting a SERVQUAL-based approach, with a focus on reliability and responsiveness to improve farmers’ satisfaction and trust. Additionally, fostering trust between farmers and the government is crucial to increasing the effectiveness of government programs and strengthening farmer–government collaboration. The study further advocates for prioritizing sustainable agricultural practices to ensure long-term productivity and environmental resilience.

First, using the unsupervised K-means machine learning algorithm, we cluster G20 countries into four groups based on similarities in the characteristics of sovereign CDS time series. We then structure our analysis around these identified clusters. Next, we use the TVP–VAR–DY and TVP–VAR–BK models to examine spillover indices from both a static and dynamic perspective. In addition, we use spatial and network visualization tools to elucidate the spillover effects across time and frequency domains. Finally, we examine the correlation of spillover structures between high and low frequency domains. Our main findings suggest that: (1) from a dynamic perspective, sovereign risk spillovers exhibit significant volatility during global extreme events, with continuous effects over time; (2) from a static perspective, developing countries are primarily net exporters of sovereign risk, while most developed countries act as net importers. Moreover, there is evidence of spatial clustering and country development clustering effects in net sovereign risk spillovers; (3) sovereign risk has significant spillover effects, with low-frequency risk spillovers driven by high-frequency spillovers.

We study the extremal properties of the initial distribution and the transition probability kernel of the Markov chain under weak assumptions for broad classes of extremal dependence structures that cover both asymptotically dependent and asymptotically independent Markov chains. For chains with k > 1, the transition of the chain away from the exceedance involves novel functions of the k previous states, in comparison to just the single value, when k = 1. This leads to an increase in the complexity of determining the form of this class of functions, their properties, and the method of their derivation in applications. We find that it is possible to derive an affine normalization, dependent on the threshold excess, such that non-degenerate limiting behaviour of the process, in the neighbourhood of the threshold excess, is assured for all lags. We find that these normalization functions have an attractive structure that has parallels to the Yule–Walker equations. Furthermore, the limiting process is always linear in the innovations. We illustrate the results with the study of kth-order stationary Markov chains with exponential margins based on widely studied families of copula dependence structures. © The Author(s), 2024.","conditional extremes; extremal index; homogeneous and stationary Markov chain; recurrence equation; tail chain","Asymptotic analysis; Differential equations; Equations of state; Higher order statistics; Normal distribution; Conditional extreme; Dependence structures; Extremal; Extremal index; Higher-order Markov chains; Homogeneous and stationary markov chain; Normalisation; Property; Recurrence equation; Tail chain; Markov chains","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210913301"

This results to a comprehensive approach that can capture the dynamics of FSIs and forecast potential crisis episodes. The model's strength arises from the synthesis of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and HMM online recursive filters, forming a robust framework. Additionally, a feature selection module based on RF and a final classifier using XGBoost enhance the out-of-sample predictive performance. Our comparative analyses with five alternative models underscore the strong predictive power of the proposed model. A tailored feature-importance analysis highlights the substantial impact of the HMM features, emphasising their crucial role in the model's effectiveness.

However, due to the weak and intermittent nature of EH power, the performance of EH-powered IoT systems as well as its collaborative routing mechanism can severely deteriorate, rendering unpleasant data package loss during each power failure. Such a phenomenon makes conventional routing policies and energy allocation strategies impractical. Given the complexity of the problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be one of the most promising and applicable methods to address this challenge. Nevertheless, although the energy allocation and routing policy are jointly optimized by the RL method, due to the energy restriction of EH devices, the inappropriate configuration of multi-hop network topology severely degrades the data collection performance. Therefore, this article first conducts a thorough mathematical discussion and develops the topology design and validation algorithm under energy harvesting scenarios. Then, this article develops DeepIoTRouting, a distributed and scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to address the routing and energy allocation jointly for the energy harvesting powered distributed IoT system. The experimental results show that with topology optimization, DeepIoTRouting achieves at least 38.71% improvement on the amount of data delivery to sink in a 20-device IoT network, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)","deep reinforcement learning; energy harvesting; Internet of Things (IoT)","Reinforcement learning; Shape optimization; Energy; Energy allocations; Environmental friendliness; Intelligent networking; Internet of thing; Internet of things industries; Power; Reinforcement learnings; Routing policies; System energy; Deep reinforcement learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196267050"

While hydrodynamic data are inherently spatially dependent, traditional spatial models, such as Gaussian processes, are poorly suited for modeling extreme events. Spatial extreme value models with more realistic tail dependence characteristics are under active development. They are theoretically justified but give intractable likelihoods, making computation challenging for small datasets and prohibitive for continental-scale studies. We propose a process mixture model (PMM) which specifies spatial dependence in extreme values as a convex combination of a Gaussian process and a max-stable process, yielding desirable tail dependence properties but intractable likelihoods. To address this, we employ a unique computational strategy where a feed-forward neural network is embedded in a density regression model to approximate the conditional distribution at one spatial location, given a set of neighbors. We then use this univariate density function to approximate the joint likelihood for all locations by way of a Vecchia approximation. The PMM is used to analyze changes in annual maximum streamflow within the U.S. over the last 50 years and is able to detect areas which show increases in extreme streamflow over time. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2024.","Gaussian process; max-stable process; neural networks; spatial extremes; Vecchia approximation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190887313"

Previous studies apply a series of machine learning algorithms to address this issue. However, these methods are inadequate in terms of prediction efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel approach based on the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISSA) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). ISSA is an enhanced Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), which combines original SSA with fractional calculus concepts and Cauchy–Gaussian mutation, to accelerate convergence and reinforce global search capability. Then ISSA is used to search the global optimal hyper-parameters of LightGBM since the prediction performance of LightGBM is determined by numerous hyper-parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed ISSA-LightGBM approach has a superior prediction performance compared with the other five models and the ISSA possesses better convergence speed and global search capability over the other four swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. DeLong's test results show that ISSA-LightGBM is statistically significant in terms of AUC score compared to other models.

To mitigate financial risk, financial risk early warning serves as a risk uncovering mechanism enabling companies to anticipate and counter poten- tial disruptions. The present review paper aims to identify the bibliometric analysis for exploring the growth and academic evo- lution of financial risk, financial risk management, and financial risk early warning concepts. Academic literature is surveyed from the Scopus database during the period 2010-2024. The network analysis, conceptual structure, and bibliographic analysis of the selected articles are employed using VOSviewer and Bibliometric R Package. The biblioshiny technique based on the bibliometric R package was used to draw journal papers’ performance and scientific contributions by displaying distinctive features from the bibliometric method used in prior studies. The data was extracted from Scopus databases. In addition, this study comprehensively analyzes the evolution of financial risk early warning systems, highlighting significant trends and future directions. Thematic evaluation across 2010-2015, 2016-2021, and 2022-2024 reveals a shift from traditional statistical methods to advanced machine learning and AI techniques, with neural networks, random forests, and XGBoost being pivotal. Innovations like attention mechanisms and LSTM models improve prediction accuracy. The integration of sustainability factors, such as carbon neutrality and renewable energy, reflects a trend towards incorporating environmental considerations into risk management. The study underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and advanced data analytics for comprehensive financial systems.

This study proposes a four-stage methodology (avoidance, endurance, recovery, and adaptability) to enhance the resilience of road networks. We combine analysis of constructed assets and asset system performance with multiple disaster scenarios (Reactive Flood Response, Proactive Resilience Planning, and Early Warning Systems). Advanced flood Geospatial-AI models and open data sources pinpoint high-risk zones affecting crucial routes. The study investigates how resilient assets and infrastructure scenarios improve outcomes within Urban Resilience Index (CRI) planning, integrating performance metrics with cost–benefit analysis to identify effective and economically viable solutions. A case study on the Lisbon Road network subjected to flood risk analyzes the effectiveness and efficiency of these scenarios, through loss and gain cost analysis. Scenario 2, Proactive Resilience Planning, demonstrates a 7.6% increase compared to Scenario 1, Reactive Flood Response, and a 3.5% increase compared to Scenario 3, Early Warning Systems Implementation. By considering asset performance, risk optimization, and cost, the study supports resilient infrastructure strategies that minimize economic impacts, while enabling communities to withstand and recover from flood events.

However, the optimal allocation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in electrical distribution systems still pertains as a challenging issue to attain the maximum benefits. It happens due to the system’s complex behaviour and inappropriate integration of DERs that adversely affects the distribution grid. In this work, we propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of DERs with vulnerable node identification in active electrical distribution networks. A failure or extreme event at the vulnerable node would interrupt the power flow in the distribution network. Also, the power variation in these vulnerable nodes would significantly affect the operation of other linked nodes. Thus, these nodes are found suitable for the optimal placement of DERs. We demonstrate the proposed data-driven approach on a standard IEEE-123 bus test feeder. Initially, we partitioned the distribution system into optimal microgrids using graph theory and graph neural network architecture. Further, using Granger causality analysis, we identified vulnerable nodes in the partitioned microgrid, suitable for DERs integration. The placement of DERs on the vulnerable nodes enhanced network resilience. Improvement in resilience is validated by computing the percolation threshold for the microgrid networks. The results show a 37% improvement in the resilience of the system due to the optimal allocation of DERs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Complex network theory; Data-driven analysis; Distributed energy resources; Electrical distribution system; Granger causality; Graph neural network; Percolation threshold; Resilience","Complex networks; Computation theory; Electric load flow; Electric network parameters; Electric power distribution; Graph theory; Network architecture; Percolation (fluids); Sensor networks; Smart power grids; Solvents; Statistical tests; Complex network theory; Data-driven analysis; Distributed Energy Resources; Electrical distribution system; Granger Causality; Graph neural networks; Microgrid; Optimal allocation; Percolation thresholds; Resilience; Energy resources","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165112721"

The authors discovered that the policy’s primary effect is linked to banks’ financial leverage. Notably, green credit’s influence on insolvency risk is most evident in leverage risk. However, despite governmental support for green credit collaboration, prevalent information gaps between banks and green enterprises lead to misjudgments and subsequent credit losses. To address the balance between credit risk mitigation and privacy, the authors investigated vertical joint learning for a precise risk control model grounded in commercial banks’ practices.

AIoT framework splits the vehicle application into various tasks while executing them on different computing nodes. The vehicle application has different constraints, such as security, time, and accuracy, which are considered during processing them on parallel computing nodes (e.g., fog and cloud). We propose a partitioned AIoT scheme, dividing vehicular tasks into local and remote tasks. The objective is to minimize delays and efficiently execute urgent tasks, such as vehicle, pedestrian, and traffic signals on local vehicles. The existing blockchain technologies suffer from many security issues, such as anonymous node issues and malware attacks in blockchain blocks. This is why we present the combined deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-assisted Proof-of-Trust Miner (PoTM) scheme. It safely handles tasks in different blocks. The smart contract is a human-written piece of code in blockchain technologies so that malicious code can be integrated into blockchain blocks during the registration of vehicles among nodes. The main limitation of smart contracts is that they are not changeable and cannot be changed once executed for any block. To avoid this situation, we present an augmented adaptive trust management credibility score scheme (TMCSS) scheme that registers the vehicles before starting any services at blockchain miners. These registration certificates are changeable once DCNN detects any malicious activity in the vehicle data.

However, this sector faces various challenges, such as issues related to service quality, innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, as well as macro-level challenges such as globalization, geopolitical risks, failures of financial institutions, technological disruptions, climate change, demographic shifts, and regulatory changes. The impacts of these challenges on society and the economy can be both significant and unpredictable, potentially endangering sustainability. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively study services and service economies at both holistic and local levels. To this end, the objective of this study is to develop and validate an artificial-intelligence-based methodology to gain a comprehensive understanding of the service sector by identifying key parameters from the academic literature and public opinion. This methodology aims to provide in-depth insights into the creation of smarter, more sustainable services and economies, ultimately contributing to the development of sustainable future societies. A software tool is developed that employs a data-driven approach involving the use of word embeddings, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and word importance. A large dataset comprising 175 K research articles was created from the Scopus database, and after analysis, 29 distinct parameters related to the service sector were identified and grouped into 6 macro-parameters: smart society and infrastructure, digital transformation, service lifecycle management, and others. The analysis of over 112 K tweets collected from Saudi Arabia identified 11 parameters categorized into 2 macro-parameters: private sector services and government services. The software tool was used to generate a knowledge structure, taxonomy, and framework for the service sector, in addition to a detailed literature review based on over 300 research articles. The conclusions highlight the significant theoretical and practical implications of the presented study for autonomous capabilities in systems, which can contribute to the development of sustainable, responsible, and smarter economies and societies. © 2023 by the authors.","autonomous services; big data analytics; deep learning; internet of things (IoT); Natural language Processing (NLP); service economy; smart services; smart society; sustainable services","Saudi Arabia; climate change; economic conditions; government; innovation; Internet; private sector; service sector; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191963085"

(June 2021) to account for predicted climate risk shocks’ impact on a sovereign portfolio’s credit quality on a forward-looking basis and in probabilistic terms. In particular, the portfolio stress testing capability is enhanced by adjusting the severity of the credit shocks to account for climate risk-related events on an additive basis. The benefit to risk managers is that it allows understanding of the impact of climate risk in marginal terms in relation to the original credit shock. The recently created NGFS (the Network for Greening the Financial System) database makes this exercise possible. Moreover, the described approach translates the marginal impact of climate risk scenarios on the portfolio’s credit risk stress testing into capital adequacy metrics dislocations, which facilitates communicating the marginal impact of climate risk scenarios as capital consumption amounts. The paper presents an overview of the underlying model, and the methodological approach developed to adapt the credit risk stress-testing capabilities to account for climate risk using the NGFS database. Moreover, it applies the methodology to a hypothetical sovereign loan portfolio and discusses the results. Over the period considered, the study finds that the transition aspect of climate risk has a more pronounced marginal impact on a sovereign portfolio’s credit risk than the chronic physical aspect of climate risk. Moreover, the results indicate that as the world takes action to transition away from carbon, the credit risk of sovereign portfolios may be exacerbated, especially if there are delays and a lack of coordination across countries and sectors. © Henry Stewart Publications.","capital adequacy; climate risk; credit rating; LASSO; machine learning; Monte Carlo simulation; sovereign risk; stress testing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151988143"

Diverse threats from various sources are simultaneously present in many industries. Like other industries, the spinning sector of Bangladesh is bestowed with numerous operational and environmental risks. However, from our knowledge, it is completely ignored by the researchers and management of this sector to identify and control those risks. This study's main motivation is to fill the knowledge gap by using a real-world case study to identify and quantify operational and environmental risks in the spinning industry. To quantify risk variables, the application of the fuzzy synthetic evaluation methodology is a completely new approach in the spinning industry, as well as in other industries. This method determines the probability and magnitude of each risk factor and risk group, as well as the overall risk. This study identifies sixteen operational and environmental risk variables within two risk groups. One of the key findings of this study is that air pollution from flying fibers, excessive noise, inappropriate materials handling, power failure, and frequent machine breakdown are the top five risk concerns. Another important finding is that the overall risk criticality value of this sector is high, with a value of 3.97, indicating a significant level of risk. The study also offered a cause-effect diagram to identify the leading causes of risks to manage those risks effectively in the future. Overall, this study will assist real-life practitioners in identifying, ranking, managing, and controlling operational and environmental hazards in the Bangladeshi spinning sector towards minimizing such hazards and promoting cleaner production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cause-effect diagram; Environmental risk; Fuzzy synthetic evaluation; Operational risk; Risk criticality; Spinning industry","Criticality (nuclear fission); Fuzzy set theory; Hazards; Industrial economics; Petroleum industry; Risk management; Textile industry; Cause-effect diagrams; Emerging economies; Empirical model; Environmental risks; Fuzzy synthetic evaluation; Operational risks; Risk criticality; Risk groups; Risk variables; Spinning industry; Pollution control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153283065"

AI technology is being applied to service jobs in more and more industries, but AI will inevitably fail while providing service. How to carry out service recovery and obtain the understanding and forgiveness of customers is a problem that urgently needs solving in the practice and research of AI services. The purpose of this study was to explore the artificial intelligence remediation mechanism in the context of service failure and to explore the remedial utility of AI’s self-deprecating humor responses. The study conducted data collection through three experiments to test our hypotheses: study 1 verified the main effect of self-deprecating humor responses and the mediating effect of perceived sincerity and perceived intelligence; study 2 verified the moderated effect of the sense of power; and study 3 verified the moderated effect of failure experience. The experimental results show that, in the context of AI for service recovery, self-deprecating humor responses can improve customers’ willingness to tolerate failure, with perceived intelligence and perceived sincerity found to play a mediating role in this. The sense of power also plays a moderating role by affecting perceived sincerity, and failure experience has a moderate effect by affecting perceived intelligence. The theoretical contribution of the article is to introduce the perspective of AI’s self-deprecating humor service recovery, which complements theoretical research in the field of AI services.

As a result of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, food security at the global level is under threat. Ukraine’s agricultural sector suffered losses of USD 2.1 billion because of the destruction or partial damage of agricultural lands and failure to harvest crops. Agricultural land has been damaged by landmine contamination, unexploded ammunition, which poses a mortal threat to farmers, and by direct physical bombardment of agricultural land. Problem Statement. Production and productivity sustainability of agricultural production is one of the most important issues today. A system of knowledge and innovation in the agricultural sector is necessary and important. It includes organizations and cooperatives of farmers, foresters, advisers, researchers, business representatives, and public organizations. Purpose. The purpose is to conduct a correlation-regression analysis of the innovation-driven development of agriculture in Ukraine under conditions of complex threats. Material and Methods. While doing this study we have used methods of multivariate statistical analysis and taxonomy methods to assess the level of individual threats. The center of gravity method is used to select representative indicators of threats to innovation-driven development. Results. In the study, the complex threats to the innovation-driven development of agriculture have been analyzed. The matrix of distances has been calculated for the initial set of indicators characterizing a separate threat. The threat of a decrease in research and development expenditure in the forecast period has the highest impact on the level of innovation-driven development of agriculture. This is evidenced by low pairwise correlation coefficients and the overall level of innovation-driven development. Conclusions. The correlation-regression analysis of innovation-driven development of agriculture has made it possible to determine the highest threat affecting the level of innovation-driven development of agriculture. © Publisher PH “Akademperiodyka” of the NAS of Ukraine, 2023.","agrarian sector; agriculture; innovation; innovation-driven development; threats","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181832329"

To properly implement a PHM system, data-centric steps must be taken, including data acquisition and manipulation, detection of machine states, health assessment, prognosis of future failures, and advisory generation. The data generated by different data sources, such as maintenance management systems, equipment manufacturer manuals, design documentation, and process monitoring and control systems, are fundamental for PHM steps. Discovering and using the knowledge embedded in this data is relevant because, for example, data-driven techniques require knowledge, maintenance data often contain tacit knowledge that can facilitate knowledge transfer and collaboration between maintenance personnel with different levels of experience and expertise, and the knowledge related to the same types of systems could be context-dependent. However, the heterogeneity of data sources, the variety of data types, and the possibility of context-dependent data pose challenges in revealing the real value of data and discovering the useful, yet hidden, patterns embedded in maintenance data that can lead to explicit knowledge. Ontologies can effectively contribute to this issue through the organization of data, semantic annotation, integration, and checking of consistency. Several ontologies contributing to the PHM process have been proposed in the scientific literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no overview of the available ontologies contributing to the PHM steps of production systems is present in the literature. Therefore, this paper aimed to investigate the ontologies and knowledge graphs proposed in the literature for the PHM of production systems. A systematic analysis and mapping of the literature was performed, and the main information was extracted and discussed according to (i) the type and year of the publication, (ii) the ontological and non-ontological resources adopted for designing the ontology/knowledge graph, (iii) the method adopted for implementing the approach, (iv) the type of application, (v) the step(s) of the PHM process on which the article is focused, and (vi) the type of decisions (strategical, tactical, or operational) to which the ontology/knowledge graph is adopted. Subsequently, the conducted analysis led to the definition of a research agenda in the domain, including the following challenges to address: (1) alignment of the ontologies in the maintenance field with respect to top-level ontologies, (2) connection among the different PHM steps at the operational level, (3) major exploitation of the combination of data-driven AI, ontologies, and reasoning for predictive maintenance, and (4) supporting sustainability-related challenges through the connection between the production system, maintenance system, and product. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Knowledge modeling; Ontology engineering; Predictive maintenance; Production systems; Prognostics and health management","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189300390"

However, the diverse shapes and scales of water bodies pose challenges in automatically extracting them from remote sensing images. Existing methods suffer from inaccurate lake boundary extraction, inconsistent results, and failure to detect small rivers. In this study, we propose a dual-stream parallel feature aggregation network to address these limitations. Our network effectively combines global information interaction from the Swin Transformer network with deep local information integration from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, we introduce a deformable convolution-based attention mechanism module (D-CBAM) that adaptively adjusts receptive field size and shape, highlights important channels in feature maps automatically, and enhances the expressive ability of our network. Additionally, we incorporate a Feature Pyramid Attention (FPA) module during the advanced coding stage for multi-scale feature learning to improve segmentation accuracy for small water bodies. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we chose the Yellow River Basin in China as the research area and used Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite images as well as manually labelling samples to construct a dataset. On this dataset, our method achieves a 93.7% F1 score, which is a significant improvement compared with other methods. Finally, we use the proposed method to map the seasonal and permanent water bodies in the Yellow River Basin in 2021 and compare it with existing water bodies. The results show that our method has certain advantages in mapping large-scale water bodies, which not only ensures the overall integrity but also retains local details. © 2023 by the authors.","attention mechanism; convolutional neural networks; feature pyramid attention; swin transformer; Yellow River Basin","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192474820"

In this work, a new dataset that was made publicly available, collected from an industrial blower, is presented, analyzed and modeled using a Sequence-to-Sequence Stacked Sparse Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder. Specifically the right and left mounted ball bearing units were measured during several months of normal operational condition as well as during an encumbered operational state. An anomaly detection model was developed for the purpose of analyzing the operational behavior of the two bearing units. A stacked sparse Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder was successfully trained on the data obtained from the left unit under normal operating conditions, learning the underlying patterns and statistical connections of the data. The model was evaluated by means of the Mean Squared Error using data from the unit’s encumbered state, as well as using data collected from the right unit.

Besides performing computations, these devices also produce data including, for example, event logs, configuration files, network management information. When these data are analyzed, we can learn more about the devices, such as their capabilities, processing efficiency, resource usage, and failure prediction. However, these data are available in different forms and have different attributes due to the highly heterogeneous nature of DCCS. The diversity of data poses various challenges which we discuss by relating them to big data, so that we can utilize the advantages of big data analytical tools. We enumerate several existing tools that can perform the monitoring task and also summarize their characteristics. Further, we provide a general governance and sustainable architecture for DCCS, which reflects the human body’s self-healing model. The proposed model has three stages: first, it analyzes system data to acquire knowledge; second, it can leverage the knowledge to monitor and predict future conditions; and third, it takes further actions to autonomously solve any issue or to alert administrators. Thus, the DCCS model is designed to minimize the system’s downtime while optimizing resource usage. A small set of data is used to illustrate the monitoring and prediction of the performance of a system through Bayesian network structure learning.

According to previous studies, time series of recorded events, e.g., river level and stock price, usually contain a non-trivial proportion of extreme events (e.g., flood and financial crisis), which are featured with extremely large/small values, occur in time series data with a relatively low frequency, and may have huge societal consequences if overlooked by a predictive model (i.e., predictor). Despite its significance in time series, we however observe the conventional square loss in time series prediction would ignore the modeling of extreme events. Specifically, we prove the square loss as a learning objective of the predictor behaves equivalently as a Gaussian kernel density estimator (KDE) on the recorded events, which is light-tailed itself and unable to model the ground-truth event distribution, usually heavy-tailed due to the existence of extreme events. Considering the benefits of forecasting extreme events, we propose a unified loss form called Generalized Extreme Value Loss (GEVL), which bridges the misalignment between the tail parts of the estimation and the ground-truth via transformations on either the observed events or the estimator. Following the proposed framework, we present three heavy-tailed kernels, i.e., shifted Gaussian, Gumbel and Fréchet kernels, and derive the corresponding GEVLs which show different levels of trade-off between modeling effectiveness and computational resources, suitable for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on a diverse set of time series predictors and real-world datasets validate that, our novel loss form substantially enhances representative time series predictors in modeling extreme events. For example, for CO2 concentration rate prediction and stock price prediction, our proposed Fréchet GEVL respectively reduces the RMSE of 6 representative DNN-based time series predictors on extreme events by over 20\%20% and 17\%17% on average, with a maximum reduction of 29.8\%29.8%.  © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Extreme event; extreme value theory; memory network; time series prediction","Computation theory; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Job analysis; Safety engineering; Auto regressive process; Extreme events; Extreme value theory; Index; Kernel; Memory network; Predictive models; Task analysis; Time series prediction; Time-series analysis; Time series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114715007"

Recently, a new trend has been arising, advocating that researchers should also report the energy efficiency besides their model's performance in their papers. Previous research has shown that reduced precision can be helpful to improve energy efficiency. Based on this finding, we propose a simple practice to effectively improve the energy efficiency of training and inference, i.e., training the model with mixed precision and deploying it on Edge TPUs. We evaluated its effectiveness by comparing the speed-up of a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture with respect to different typical usage scenarios, including using different devices, deep learning frameworks, model sizes, and batch sizes. Our results show that enabled mixed precision can gain up to a 1.9× speedup compared to the most common and default float32 data type on GPUs. Deploying the models on Edge TPU further boosted the inference by a factor of 6. Our approach allows researchers to accelerate their training and inference procedures without jeopardizing the model's accuracy, meanwhile reducing energy consumption and electricity cost easily without changing their model architecture or retraining. Furthermore, our approach is helpful in reducing the carbon footprint used to train and deploy the neural network and thus has a positive effect on environmental resources.  © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; edge TPU; energy efficiency; green AI; mixed precision training; quantization","Biological systems; Carbon footprint; Computer graphics; Costs; Deep neural networks; Energy utilization; Graphics processing unit; Life cycle; Network architecture; Program processors; Semantics; Biological system modeling; Computational modelling; Deep learning; Edge TPU; Green AI; Green products; Mixed precision; Mixed precision training; Neural-networks; Quantisation; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162717525"

However, the pic-ture has shifted in the last decade, with a significant increase in the number of sovereign defaults. The drivers of this increase are complex and as yet unexplored, but it is clear that factors other than traditional macroeconomic events are significantly underpinning these economies. Therefore, understanding how the drivers of sovereign credit risk have evolved beyond economic and fiscal issues, as well as the importance of additional drivers in sovereign credit risk assessment, is critical. This paper explains the strength of the effect of spillover effects from private sector risks on sovereign debt risk, as well as the impact of rising sustainability risks on sovereign credit risk and their underlying relationship, using the XGBoost classification algorithm and model interpretability techniques, namely Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). First, we dis-cover that private sector risks contribute significantly to sovereign credit risk and that these factors must be considered alongside macroeconomic variables when modeling sovereign credit risk. Further, we find evidence that sustainability risks are financially material to sovereign creditworthiness. The relationship between sustainability risks and sovereign credit risk is complex, follows a nonmonotonic relationship and is highly dependent on country specificities, necessitating the integration of sustain-ability risk factors while accounting for interactions with the economic state of a country. © 2023 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","private sector risks; sovereign credit risk; spillover effects; sustainability risks; XGBoost","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159099808"

We identify the flaws in the models and analyses which contend that there must be a trade-off and explain the mechanisms and dynamic forces which have the potential to enhance growth. Critically, there are numerous market failures that result in suboptimal economic performance. We explain how addressing climate change reduces the bite of these failures and enhances the incentives and political will to address them. We identify packages of policies that alleviate market failures, enhance growth, and reduce carbon emissions. Finally, we argue that the green transition is coming at a time when, both because of persistent deficiencies of aggregate demand and advances in technology, including artificial intelligence and robotization, the macroeconomic opportunity costs of strong climate actions may be especially low and the benefits particularly high. © The Author(s) 2023.

It is essential to detect damage in a timely fashion to ensure the safe operation of the structure. If left unchecked, subsurface damage (SSD) can cause significant internal damage and may result in premature structural failure. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been developed for SSD detection using surface strain measurements. The adopted network architecture is capable of pixel-level image segmentation, that is, it classifies each location of strain measurement as damaged or undamaged. The CNN which is fed full-field strain measurements as an input image of size 256 × 256 projects the SSD onto an output image of the same size. The data for network training is generated by numerical simulation of aluminum bars with different damage scenarios, including single damage and double damage cases at a random location, direction, length, and thickness. The trained network achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.790 for the validation set and 0.794 for the testing set. To check the applicability of the trained network on materials other than aluminum, testing is performed on a numerically generated steel dataset. The IoU score is 0.793, the same as the aluminum dataset, affirming the network’s capability to apply to materials exhibiting a similar stress–strain relationship. To check the generalization potential of the network, it is tested on triple damage cases; the IoU score is found to be 0.764, suggesting that the network works well for unseen damage patterns as well. The network was also found to provide accurate predictions for real experimental data obtained from Strain Sensing Smart Skin (S4). This proves the efficacy of the network to work in real-life scenarios utilizing the full potential of the novel full-field strain sensing methods such as S4. The performance of the proposed network affirms that it can be used as a non-destructive testing method for subsurface crack detection and localization. © 2023 by the authors.","convolutional neural network; damage localization; full-field strain; non-destructive testing; Strain Sensing Smart Skin; subsurface damage","Aluminum; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crack detection; Damage detection; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Image segmentation; Network architecture; Statistical tests; Strain; Strain measurement; Structural health monitoring; Convolutional neural network; Damage localization; Extreme events; Full-field strain; Non destructive testing; Smart skin; Strain sensing; Strain sensing smart skin; Sub-surface damage; Surface strains; Nondestructive examination","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170351745"

The mathematical model employs an annual rebalancing strategy subject to a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint while considering practical and Islamic trading concerns, including transaction costs, holding limits, and zakat payment. To validate the model, the optimal portfolios are compared against an Islamic benchmark index, a market index, and portfolios generated by the mean-variance model, as well as a forecast accuracy test by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Arctangent Percentage Error. Furthermore, this study examines the inter-stock relationship within the generated portfolios using correlation and Granger causality tests to identify the diversification performance. Results show an outperformance of the model in offering portfolios with higher risk-adjusted returns under a comparably short computational time and an indication of generally well-diversified portfolios by the weak correlations between securities. The study further noted that the model is adept at risk management in addition to higher forecast accuracy during financial crises by showing remarkably fewer causal relationships during bear markets in 2011, 2014, and 2020. The findings of an inversed relationship between portfolio risk and the number of causalities between securities offer new insights into the effect of dynamic relationships between securities on portfolio diversification. In conclusion, the proposed model carries higher moral and social values than the conventional models while portraying high potential in enhancing the efficiency of asset allocation, contributing to economic diversification and the scarce literature on Islamic portfolio optimization modelling. The study also supports the substantially increasing demand for Shariah-compliant strategies following globalization and the changing demographic of the real financial world with growing priorities of social and sustainability values. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","causality; diversification; economic diversification; Islamic finance; portfolio optimization; Shariah-compliant portfolio","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163701511"

Farmed bivalves, by ingesting large amounts of phytoplankton, can become unsafe for human consumption due to the bioaccumulation of okadaic acid (OA), causing Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP). Whenever the OA concentration in shellfish farmed in a specific area exceeds the established legal limit (160 μg·kg−1 of OA equivalents), harvesting activities are compulsorily suspended. This study aimed at developing a machine learning (ML) predictive model for OA bioaccumulation in Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) farmed in the coastal area off the Po River Delta (Veneto, Italy), based on oceanographic data measured through remote sensing and data deriving from the monitoring activities performed by official veterinarian authorities to verify the bioaccumulation of OA in the shellfish production sites. LightGBM was used as an ML algorithm. The results of the classification algorithm on the test set showed an accuracy of 82%. Further analyses showed that false negatives were mainly associated with relatively low levels of toxins (<100 μg·kg−1), since the algorithm tended to classify low concentrations of OA as negative samples, while true positives had higher mean values of toxins (139 μg·kg−1). The results of the model could be used to build up an online early warning system made available to shellfish farmers of the study area, aimed at increasing the economic and environmental sustainability of these production activities and reducing the risk of massive product losses. © 2023 by the authors.","harmful algal blooms; LightGBM algorithm; machine learning; okadaic acid; remote sensing; shellfish","Adriatic Sea; Delta; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Nigeria; Po River; Veneto; algal bloom; algorithm; bioaccumulation; bivalve; dinoflagellate; early warning system; harvesting; machine learning; phytoplankton; remote sensing; shellfish","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161615717"

In the verification scheme, access interrupts the controllers, and the schedules are initiated using the learning paradigm. This learning process considers the achievable production outcome and the low or high variations in the current access-based output. Therefore, the access control and security features are extended depending on the learning output over the adversaries.

However, the large amounts of collected data must be stored, processed and evaluated in a proper way. In practice, challenges of continuous and exact data collection can arise, e.g., from air pollutants like dust occluding cameras and sensors, degrading material, the ever-present commotion caused by animals, workers and machines, regularly required maintenance or weak signal transmission. In this study, we analyzed the quality of multi-source spatio-temporal data from a broiler house with 8100 birds over a period of 31 months collected by the Farmer Assistant System (FAS). This is a ceiling-suspended robot equipped with several sensors and cameras that continuously collect data while moving through the barn. The data analysis revealed numerous irregularities: missing values, outliers, repetitive measurements, systematic errors, and temporal and spatial inconsistencies. About 40–50% of all records collected with the early version of the FAS had to be sorted out. The newer version of FAS provided cleaner data, although still about 10–20% of the data had to be removed. Our study has shown that where sophisticated technological systems meet a challenging environment, a thorough and critical review of data completeness and quality is crucial to avoid misinterpretation. The pipeline developed here is designed to help developers and farmers detect failures in signal processing and localize the problem in the hardware components. Scientists, industrial developers and farmers should work more closely together to develop new PLF technologies to more easily advance digitization in agriculture. © 2023 by the authors.","big data; broiler; precision livestock farming; real-time monitoring","animal welfare; data quality; livestock farming; monitoring; real time","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199225285"

The objective is to develop “Decomposed Fuzzy Set-Based FMEA (DF FMEA)” by extending the well-known failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method to DFS, to assess risks in the food cold chain. The functional and dysfunctional questions related to the severity, occurrence, and detectability of the identified risks; they were addressed to three experts working on the food cold chain. The purpose is to prevent an inconsistent assignment considering the uncertainty and indecision of decision makers. Due to the implementation of the DF FMEA, the identified risks were prioritized as follows: “Financial Risks” held the highest priority, followed by “Delivery Risks”, “Technological Ability Risks”, “Environmental Risks”, “Quality Risks”, and “Social Risks” with the lowest priority. The study’s practical impact lies in the innovative risk assessment method. By considering decision makers’ preferences and uncertainties, the DF FMEA approach enhances informed decision making. This contributes to a robust framework for addressing risks in the food cold chain, aiding practitioners in more effective risk management. © 2023 by the authors.","decomposed fuzzy sets (DFS); failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA); food cold chain; risk analysis","food chain; food supply; fuzzy mathematics; policy implementation; risk assessment; supply chain management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170396740"

By using performance indicators (PIs), stakeholders can objectively measure the performance of EMP implementation, identifying areas of success and areas that may require improvement. Therefore, this study aims to examine the PIs for assessing EMP implementation in water supply construction projects, using Saudi Arabia as a case study. Data from semi-structured interviews and a systematic literature review were used to develop a potential list of PIs. Then, the PIs were used to create a survey and distributed to industry professionals. Data from 112 respondents were analyzed using mean ranking analysis, the normalization method, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE). Eighteen critical PIs for assessing EMP implementation in water supply construction projects were identified, including public safety, road safety hazards, construction waste, clogged drainage, irregular flooding, the spilling of chemical substances, slope failures, soil erosion, landslide occurrence, increased schedule waste, changes in the color of bodies of water, oil/fuel spills, restricted site accessibility, the smell of run-off water, traffic accidents on construction sites, the spread of disease, changes in the color of run-off water, and overflowing silt traps. The EFA revealed that PIs can be grouped into three underlying constructs: fluid-related indicators, health and safety-related indicators, and site environment-related indicators. The FSE results confirmed that all PIs are between moderately critical to critical. This study’s significance lies in its examination of PIs that aim to improve the environmental performance of water supply construction projects. Understanding which indicators are most effective allows for targeted improvements, helping to minimize negative environmental impacts and ensuring sustainable practices. Finally, this study is a pioneer in examining the critical PIs for assessing EMP implementation in water supply construction projects. © 2024 by the authors.","EFA; EMP; environmental management plan; exploratory factor analysis; FSE; fuzzy synthetic evaluation; Saudi Arabia; water supply construction projects","Saudi Arabia; construction; environmental assessment; environmental impact; fuzzy mathematics; literature review; performance assessment; runoff; water supply","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183339104"

This depends on the integrity/performance of the ship structure and vital systems, such as the ship propulsion engine. The current research paper presents the application of an adaptive machine learning formalism, the Bayesian network, for failure assessment of a ship propulsion engine considering nonlinear and nonsequential failure interactions. The model captures critical failure influencing factors and their complex interactions to predict the failure probability of the ship energy system. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis was carried out to establish the degree of influence of vital failure influencing factors as they affect the ship propulsion engine’s reliability and the associated uncertainty in the prior data processing. The model is tested on the propulsion engine of an ocean going vessel to forecast the likelihood of failure based on the logical dependencies among failure causative factors. Two scenarios were analyzed based on canonical probabilistic algorithms, and the results show that upon evidence on the three critical failure modes, the ship propulsion engine failure likelihood increased by 11.8%, 8.2%, and 9.4%, respectively. The model shows an adaptive/dynamic capability to capture new failure information and update the system’s failure probability.

Moreover, every year enormous crop loss is encountered either by pests, specific diseases, or natural disasters. It raises a strong concern to employ sustainable advanced technologies to address agriculture-related issues. In this article, a sustainable real-time crop disease detection and prevention system, called CROPCARE, is proposed. The system integrates mobile vision, Internet of Things (IoT), and Google Cloud services for sustainable growth of crops. The primary function of the proposed intelligent system is to detect crop diseases through the CROPCARE - mobile application. It uses the superresolution convolution network (SRCNN) and the pretrained model MobileNet-V2 to generate a decision model trained over various diseases. To maintain sustainability, the mobile app is integrated with IoT sensors and Google Cloud services. The proposed system also provides recommendations that help farmers know about current soil conditions, weather conditions, disease prevention methods, etc. It supports both Hindi and English dictionaries for the convenience of the farmers.

Monitoring indices for the surrounding rock are vital for the safety management of underground engineering construction, which determines the actual state of the surrounding rock. The complexity of deep underground engineering construction leads to many situations that cannot be predicted and explained by existing experience. Therefore, it is necessary to identify which monitoring index best represents the surrounding rock damage. Currently, there are no advanced and convenient effectiveness evaluation schemes for surrounding rock monitoring information. To fill the technical gap, this study introduces the volume expansion rate (VER) index for surrounding rock and proposes a machine learning (ML)-based evaluation scheme for the effectiveness of monitoring indices. First, six conditions with different in situ stresses are designed, and tunnel excavation monitoring tests are conducted. Second, the surrounding rock damage determination experiments using the ML classification algorithm are performed, and the accuracy matrix and index significance scores are obtained. The evaluation results show that: (1) The multi-class logistic regression algorithm is more suitable for determining surrounding rock damage with high accuracy and more appropriate significance evaluation outcomes. (2) Under the higher in situ stress condition, the tangential stress is more sensitive to the surrounding rock damage. (3) As the in situ stress increases, the significant monitoring indices demonstrate a transition ‘from shallow to deep, from regional damage to point failure’, describing the instability of the surrounding rock and inspiring a new instability criterion for surrounding rock. © 2023 by the authors.","effectiveness evaluation; machine learning; surrounding rock damage determination; surrounding rock monitoring; volume expansion rate","algorithm; damage mechanics; excavation; in situ stress; index method; instability; machine learning; rock mass classification; sustainability; volume","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170403624"

By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and LSTM networks, we develop predictive models that dynamically analyze real-time and historical data to accurately forecast the success or failure of crowdfunding campaigns. To address the existing gaps in crowdfunding analysis tools, we introduce two novel datasets—one for equity crowdfunding and another for lending. Moreover, our approach extends beyond traditional binary success metrics, proposing novel measures.

For this reason, the uninterrupted operation of robots in manufacturing is important for the sustainability of autonomy. Detecting possible fault symptoms that may cause failures within a work environment will help to eliminate interrupted operations. When supervised learning methods are considered, obtaining and storing labeled, historical training data in a manufacturing environment with faults is a challenging task. In addition, sensors in mobile devices such as robots are exposed to different noisy external conditions in production environments affecting data labels and fault mapping. Furthermore, relying on a single sensor data for fault detection often causes false alarms for equipment monitoring. Our study takes requirements into consideration and proposes a new unsupervised machine-learning algorithm to detect possible operational faults encountered by autonomous mobile robots. The method suggests using an ensemble of multi-sensor information fusion at the decision level by voting to enhance decision reliability. The proposed technique relies on dissimilarity-based sensor data segmentation with an adaptive threshold control. It has been tested experimentally on an autonomous mobile robot. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for detecting operational anomalies. Furthermore, the proposed voting mechanism is also capable of eliminating false positives in case of a single source of information is utilized. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Autonomous mobile robot; Fault detection; Multi-sensor information fusion; Unsupervised learning","Information fusion; Learning algorithms; Navigation; Sustainable development; Unsupervised learning; Autonomous Mobile Robot; Critical component; Detection methods; Fault symptoms; Faults detection; Manufacturing IS; Multi-sensor information fusion; Sensors data; Uninterrupted operations; Work environments; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174911209"

The use of these covenants is significantly associated with borrowers’ environmental risk exposure, borrower–lender information asymmetry, and key contract terms, such as collateral and loan maturity. The association between environmental risk and environmental covenants is more pronounced when borrowers face greater financial distress, lenders have a stronger reputation, and there is a higher risk of regulatory enforcement. Additional analysis shows that the presence of a board committee overseeing environmental matters reduces lenders’ demand to contractually address the borrower’s environmental risk.

Acknowledging the pivotal role of financial stability as a cornerstone of sustainability, this study undertakes a comparative investigation between statistical models forecasting business failure and artificial intelligence-based models within the context of the transport sector. The analysis spans the temporal period from 2014 to 2021 and encompasses a dataset of 4866 companies from four South European countries: Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy. The models created were linear support vector machines (L-SVMs), kernel support vector machines (K-SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs), logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DTs), random forests (RFs), extremely random forests (ERFs), AdaBoost, and neural networks (NNs). The models were implemented in Python using the scikit-learn package. The results revealed that most models exhibited high precision and accuracy, ranging from 71% to 73%, with the ERF model outperforming others in both predictive capacity and accuracy. It was also observed that artificial intelligence-based models outperformed statistical models in predicting business failure, with particular emphasis on the AdaBoost and ERF models. Thus, we conclude that the results confirm the hypothesis that the artificial intelligence models were superior in all metrics compared to the results obtained by logistic regression. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; business failure; financial indicators; financial sustainability; forecasting; transport sector","France; Italy; Portugal; Spain; artificial intelligence; financial crisis; software; sustainability; temporal period; transport structure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199228045"

In addition, this gap is not filled even by the supporting methods that have been conceived to only support specific areas of application. To fill this gap, this study proposed a method to support social failure mode and effect analysis (SFMEA), though the automatic failure determination, based on the use of a chatbot (i.e., an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chat). The method consists of 84 specific questions to ask the chatbot, resulting from the combination of known failures and social failures, elements from design theories, and syntactic structures. The starting hypothesis to be verified is that a GPT Chat (i.e., a common AI-based chat), properly queried, can provide all the main elements for the automatic compilation of a SFMEA (i.e., to determine the social failures). To do this, the proposed questions were tested in three case studies to extract all the failures and elements that express predefined SFMEA scenarios: a coffee cup provoking gender discrimination, a COVID mask denying a human right, and a thermometer undermining the cultural heritage of a community. The obtained results confirmed the starting hypothesis by showing the strengths and weaknesses of the obtained answers in relation to the following factors: the number and type of inputs (i.e., the failures) provided in the questions; the lexicon used in the question, favoring the use of technical terms derived from design theories and social sustainability taxonomies; the type of the problem. Through this test, the proposed method proved its ability to support the social sustainable design of different products and in different ways. However, a dutiful recommendation instead concerns the tool (i.e., the chatbot) due to its filters that limit some answers in which the designer tries to voluntarily hypothesize failures to explore their social consequences. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; chatbot; social FMEA; social sustainability","artificial intelligence; coffee; cultural heritage; gender discrimination; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161714310"

Eliminating undesirable damage to the means of transport through the possibility of predicting technical conditions and a state of failure may increase the reliability of the entire supply chain. From the aspect of sustainability, the issue of reducing the number of failures also makes it possible to reduce supply chain disturbances, to reduce costs associated with delays, and to reduce the materials needed for the repair of the means of transport, since, in this case, the costs only relate to the replaced elements before their damage. Thus, it is impossible for more serious damage to occur. Often, failure of one item causes damage to others, which generates unnecessary costs and increases the amount of waste due to the number of damaged items. This article provides an author’s method of technical condition prediction; by applying the method, it would be possible to develop recommended maintenance activities for key elements related to the safety and reliability of transport. The combination of at least two artificial intelligence methods allows us to achieve very good prediction results thanks to the possibility of individual adjustments of weights between the methods used.

We apply a newly developed econometric model, namely Panel Quantile Regression via Moment Conditions, considering the scale and location effect due to high heterogeneity in our panel time series data over 1990–2020. Our empirical investigation shows that the budget deficit promotes economic growth sustainability in the overall sample countries. The comparative analysis confirms that budget deficit promotes economic growth for welfare countries while it impends for non-welfare countries. Furthermore, QOG augments sustainable economic growth in different economic circumstances in welfare countries and non-welfare countries. Finally, the results also demonstrate that the QOG plays a supportive role in the nexus between budget deficit and economic growth in the full sample countries. The findings indicate that the effectiveness of the budget deficit varies across welfare and non-welfare countries.

Due to their high hardness (60 HRC or more), conventional bending and rolling straightening approaches are not effective, as a failure of the material occurs. The aim of the research was to develop a predictive model that predicts the change in the form of a hardened workpiece as a function of the arbitrary set of strikes that deform the surface plastically. A large-scale laboratory experiment was carried out in which a database of 3063 samples was prepared, based on the controlled application of plastic deformations on the surface of the workpiece and high-resolution capture of the workpiece geometry. The different types of input data, describing, on the one hand, the performed plastic surface deformations on the workpieces, and on the other hand the point cloud of the workpiece geometry, were combined appropriately into a form that is a suitable input for a U-Net convolutional neural network. The U-Net model’s performance was investigated using three statistical indicators. These indicators were: relative absolute error (RAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and relative squared error (RSE). The results showed that the model had excellent prediction performance, with the mean values of RMSE less than 0.013, RAE less than 0.05, and RSE less than 0.004 on test data. Based on the results, we concluded that the proposed model could be a useful tool for designing an optimal straightening strategy for high-hardness metal workpieces. Our results will open the doors to implementing digital sustainability techniques, since more efficient handling will result in fewer subsequent heat treatments and shorter handling times. An important goal of digital sustainability is to reduce electricity consumption in production, which this approach will certainly do. © 2023 by the authors.","digital sustainability; hardened workpiece; manufacturing; modeling; point cloud; straightening process; U-Net convolutional neural network","artificial neural network; experimental study; manufacturing; modeling; plastic deformation; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156184221"

In addition to providing a risk score, the Risk Advisor decomposes the uncertainty estimates into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components, thus giving informative insights into the sources of uncertainty inducing the failures. Consequently, Risk Advisor can distinguish between failures caused by data variability, data shifts and model limitations and provide useful guidance on appropriate risk mitigation actions (e.g., collecting more data to counter data shift). Extensive experiments on various families of black-box classification models and on real-world and synthetic datasets covering common ML failure scenarios show that the Risk Advisor reliably predicts deployment-time failure risks in all the scenarios, and outperforms strong baselines. © 2022, The Author(s).","Failure analysis; Trustworthy ML; Uncertainty modeling","Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Learning systems; Risk perception; Black boxes; Classification models; Datum shifts; Failure risk; Machine-learning; Potential failures; Trustworthy machine learning; Uncertainty; Uncertainty models; Via modeling; Uncertainty analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140101332"

First, You Only Look Once-v4 (Yolo-v4) algorithm based on deep learning can greatly improve the accuracy of object detection in an image, and trackers, including Sort and Deepsort, resolved the identity switch problem to track efficiently the multiple objects. To that end, this study combined Yolo-v4 with Sort and Deepsort to develop two trajectory models, which are known as YS and YDS, respectively. In addition, different regions of interest (ROI) with different pixel distances (PDs), named ROI-10 and ROI-14, were converted by road marking to calibrate the PD. Finally, a high-resolution benchmark video and two real-time low-resolution videos of highway both were employed to validate this proposed framework. Results show the YDS with ROI-10 achieved 90% accuracy of vehicle counting, when compared to the number of actual vehicles, and this outperformed the YS with ROI-10. However, the YDS with ROI-14 generated relatively good estimates of vehicle velocity. As shown in the real-time low-resolution videos, the YDS with ROI-10 achieved 89.5% and 83.7% accuracy of vehicle counting in Nantun and Daya sites of highway, respectively, and reasonable estimates of vehicle velocity were obtained. In the future, more bus and light truck images could be collected to effectively train the Yolo-v4 and improve the detection of bus and light truck. A better mechanism for precise vehicle velocity estimation and the vehicle detection in different environment conditions should be further investigated. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Environmental sustainability; Object detection; Object tracking; Traffic parameter","Deep learning; Image enhancement; Object recognition; Road and street markings; Sustainable development; Tracking (position); Trucks; Deep learning; Environmental sustainability; Object Tracking; Objects detection; Real- time; Region-of-interest; Regions of interest; Traffic parameters; Vehicle counting; Vehicle velocity; Object detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176263130"

In this work we analyze the UK-biobank colorectal cancer data with genetic and environmental risk factors, including a time-dependent coefficient, which transforms the dataset into “pseudo-observation” form, thus, critically inflating its size. A popular way for coping with massive datasets is downsampling them, such that the computational resources can be afforded by the researcher. Cox regression has remained one of the most popular statistical models for the analysis of survival data to-date. This work addresses the settings of right censored and possibly left-truncated data with rare events, such that the observed failure times constitute only a small portion of the overall sample. We propose Cox regression subsampling-based estimators that approximate their full-data partial-likelihood-based counterparts, by assigning optimal sampling probabilities to censored observations, and including all observed failures in the analysis. The suggested methodology is applied on the UK-biobank for building a colorectal cancer risk-prediction model, while reducing the computation time and memory requirements. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established under suitable regularity conditions, and simulation studies are carried out to evaluate their finite sample performance.

This boost leads to an increase in energy consumption, much of it associated with computing in data centers. This fact clashes with the growing need to save and improve energy efficiency and requires a more optimized use of resources. The deployment of new services in edge and cloud computing, virtualization, and software-defined networks requires a better understanding of consumption patterns aimed at more efficient and sustainable models and a reduction in carbon footprints. These patterns are suitable to be exploited by machine, deep, and reinforced learning techniques in pursuit of energy consumption optimization, which can ideally improve the energy efficiency of data centers and big computing servers providing these kinds of services. For the application of these techniques, it is essential to investigate data collection processes to create initial information points. Datasets also need to be created to analyze how to diagnose systems and sort out new ways of optimization. This work describes a data collection methodology used to create datasets that collect consumption data from a real-world work environment dedicated to data centers, server farms, or similar architectures. Specifically, it covers the entire process of energy stimuli generation, data extraction, and data preprocessing.

With the effect of recent trends, such as the use of machine learning, data mining, and reinforcement learning methods, the maintenance decision has been a dynamic issue depending on system conditions. An expert may execute the maintenance or wait for the next periodic maintenance due to lack of maintenance workers, tools or budget, resources, etc., although the intelligent method predicts a failure approaching. Even sometimes, he/she may ignore the current periodic maintenance. Our method allows making some changes in the maintenance plan systematically. It integrates the results of preventive and predictive maintenance policies, and as different from the literature, it allows ignoring some maintenance actions depending on the maintenance resource levels in a decision table. Such a strategy helps to allocate limited resources to maintenance actions reasonably. We conducted an extensive simulation study on a real-life dataset. The preventive maintenance period is determined using classical approaches such as Weibull analysis. A machine learning algorithm is utilized to predict the type of failure. We have analyzed the performance of the proposed decision table approach under a variety of scenarios and with different parameter settings. We also showed the effect of parameter settings and the marginal utility of each maintenance policy. In addition, the approach provides several choices for planners.

Governments in the Global North and international institutions maintain that the bioeconomy can gradually replace fossil-based raw materials and nonrenewable resources with biomass and biological renewables. The Global South has increasingly adopted the approach, but with important variations across mega-biodiverse regions. In these regions, the bioeconomy must encourage economic activities that preserve biodiversity and strengthen local communities, promoting their well-being and cultural diversity. This paper argues that conventional research methods and indicators are not fit for this purpose. We therefore propose an alternative method and indicators and present an initial validation of the approach with an application to the pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) value chain in the Brazilian Amazon. By applying a bottom-up approach to evaluation that considers the perspective of the individuals and communities involved, the proposed methodology captures relevant dimensions of the value chain—including trade-offs—while identifying bottlenecks and the role of institutions. It also allows for verification of the achievement of the objectives of the socio-biodiversity bioeconomy in this model. The application to the case study finds that the managed pirarucu fisheries are a viable value chain associated with improved fish stocks and lower than average forest loss. Socio-economic benefits include the generation of reasonable income and greater participation by women. Income remains a complement to other sources of livelihood, however, and attractiveness to local communities is an issue. Positive outcomes are owed largely to local knowledge, collective action, and the role played by meta-organizations, while negative ones such as overfishing have resulted from institutional failures. Conventional analysis would likely not have considered these factors and missed these policy lessons. This corroborates the view that alternative methods and indicators are needed for the socio-biodiversity bioeconomy. While the application to the case study suggests the method and the indicators are conceptually suitable, we identify a number of shortcomings regarding the identification of interventions, attribution, and monitoring of the sustainability of the model. © 2023 by the authors.","bioeconomy; evaluating metrics; methods; socio-biodiversity; supply chains","Amazon River; biodiversity; econometrics; finfish; socioeconomic conditions; supply chain management; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160689032"

To ensure the idea of the company development, the authors of the present study relied on the situational approach which defines management as specific circumstance that requires adequate actions to solve it. The purpose of the research is focused on the practical aspects of making managerial decisions in the conditions of a crisis economy to ensure the financial stability of medium and small enterprises (SMEs). For this, the methods of analysis and syn-thesis, expert evaluation, fuzzy logic, and the situational approach were used. This article focuses on the three main reasons, including: i) increase in the risk of financial stability losses by small and medium-sized companies, ii) insufficient use of analytical and information technologies, iii) the complexity of decision-making in conditions of crisis and uncertainty. The research was carried out in the following areas: 1) analysis of risks to the financial stability of companies associated with crisis phenomena in the economy, 2) assessment of the risk of financial stability loss based on the method of fuzzy logic, 3) formation of the configuration of management decisions to ensure the financial stability of the company in the conditions of a crisis economy based on the situational approach. The results revealed the relevance of the research and the reliability and sustainability of the research tools. Based on the results, the most important problems of the companies were identified, an approach to assessing the risk of losing financial stability by the company was proposed based on the method of fuzzy logic, and practical recommendations were given on how to determine the configuration of managerial decision-making based on the management determinants.

The analysis covers the time span from 1990 to 2019. The empirical strategy uses the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) and long-run estimators (Fixed Effects Ordinary Least Squares, FE-OLS; Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares, DOLS; and Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, FMOLS). The findings highlight the presence of a cointegrating relationship. Moreover, fossil fuels and economic growth cause LF to decrease, while economic risk and the use of renewable energy sources increase the deepening of the LF. Furthermore, the results of the MMQR method are confirmed by DOLS, FMOLS, and FE-OLS estimates. Causality results also demonstrate that these factors may forecast ecological quality, indicating that policies for renewable energy consumption, financial risk, renewable energy, and economic growth can all have an impact on the degree of LF.

Specifically, “Where the asset is expected to continue beyond the explicit forecast period, valuers must estimate the value of the asset at the end of that period. The terminal value is then discounted back to the valuation date, normally using the same discount rate as applied to the forecast cash flow” (IVS 105 Valuation Approaches and Methods, para 50.20). Although academic and professional normally refer to direct capitalization to calculate the exit value (scrap value, going out value) different approaches are possible. In particular it is possible to calculate the exit value using the market approach. The present work starts from an original model of Discounted Cash Flow Analysis proposed by Simonotti (2006) to propose possible alternative to the original formula. The model proposed, as defined for the paper “Prudential Value DCFA Formula (PVF)” provides methodological alternatives to the original model in order to apply the method in different property market conditions allowing the appraiser to represent even property market in recovery or falling market phase, or prudential assessment of worth and opinion of value. In particular the proposed model replace the compound growth of the property value included in the traditional Simonotti’s model, with a linear growth or even a combination of both. The paper emphasize how property valuation standards can not be considered as immutable but they may be considered in constant evolution. In delivering an opinion of value for mortgage lending purposes the approach of professional academician and real estate analyst need to be able to respond to change of external conditions, in consideration of the sustainability of the cash flows in the long term, for the entire duration of the loan (and therefore for the purpose of identifying the long-term sustainable value of the asset). The approach is functional, inter alia, for the purpose of identifying the “prudential value” as defined by the innovative banking regulation (Basel 3) according to the definition of loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for loan origination and monitoring. © 2023 D’Amato, M., & Bambagioni, G.

Decision making using system data informatics under adverse dynamic events, especially if forecasted, should be supplemented by intelligent proactive control. Power transmission system operation during wildfires requires resiliency-driven proactive control for load shedding, line switching, and resource allocation considering the dynamics of the wildfire and failure propagation to minimize the impact on the system. However, the possible number of line and load switching in an extensive industrial system during an event make the traditional prediction-driven and stochastic approaches computationally intractable, leading operators to often use preplanned or greedy algorithms. In this article, we model and solve the proactive control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and introduce an integrated testbed for spatiotemporal wildfire propagation and proactive power-system operation. Our approach allows the controller to provide setpoints for all generation fleets in the power grid. We evaluate our approach utilizing the IEEE test system mapped onto a hypothetical terrain. Our results show that the proposed approach can help the operator to reduce load outage during an extreme event. It reduces power flow through lines that are to be de-energized and adjusts the load demand by increasing power flow through other lines.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Industrial power system; intelligent control; proactive control; reinforcement learning (RL); resiliency; wildfire","Behavioral research; Decision making; Electric load flow; Electric load shedding; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission; Markov processes; Outages; Personnel training; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Stochastic systems; Industrial power systems; Load modeling; Power; Power system; Proactive control; Reinforcement learnings; Resilience; Resiliency; Resource management; Symbol; Wildfire; Fires","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153407324"

The primary objective of this article is to assess the significance of financial management in contributing to the stability and profitability of organizations. To investigate the role and significance of financial management in ensuring the stability and profitability of organizations, this article analyzes the financial policies and management practices employed by prominent agricultural enterprises in Ukraine. The authors assess the financial stability and profitability indicators achieved through effective management of financial resources and decision-making by enterprise management. The study investigates the outcomes of consistent financial management strategies, policies, and tactics employed by agricultural enterprises during a period of heightened uncertainty and volatility in both domestic and international markets in 2022. These companies continued to prioritize sustainable development strategies, wherein the economic aspect aimed not only at ensuring sustainability and profitability but also at funding social and environmental initiatives. Financial management within the context of market volatility encompassed the following aspects: 1) conducting scenario analysis of the external environment and quantifying potential losses; 2) analyzing and assessing key financial risks such as currency, credit, and investment risks; 3) adapting financial management strategies to changes in macroeconomic factors; and 4) considering the environmental and social components as well as the costs associated with implementing relevant programs in financial practices. The surveyed companies exhibited variations in their dividend policies, with one company adopting a cautious dividend approach, while another experienced an increase in dividend payouts in 2022. Furthermore, these companies prioritized investment policies that emphasized innovation and technological advancements. Financial strategies implemented by agricultural enterprises encompassed growth, expansion, and international diversification. This article unveils the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and machine learning algorithms by these companies to enable real-time analysis and control of financial resources, as well as to forecast and facilitate decision-making processes. Common concerns among agricultural companies revolved around effectively managing and maintaining adequate levels of absolute liquidity.

However, extreme stock market events are particularly hard to model because of their scarce and erratic nature. Moreover, strong trading strategies, market stress tests, and portfolio optimization largely rely on sound data. While the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for stock forecasting has been an active area of research, there is still a gap in the literature on using GANs for extreme market movement prediction and simulation. In this study, we proposed a framework based on GANs to efficiently model stock prices’ extreme movements. By creating synthetic real-looking data, the framework simulated multiple possible market-evolution scenarios, which can be used to improve the forecasting quality of future market variations. The fidelity and predictive power of the generated data were tested by quantitative and qualitative metrics. Our experimental results on S&P 500 and five emerging market stock data show that the proposed framework is capable of producing a realistic time series by recovering important properties from real data. The results presented in this work suggest that the underlying dynamics of extreme stock market variations can be captured efficiently by some state-of-the-art GAN architectures. This conclusion has great practical implications for investors, traders, and corporations willing to anticipate the future trends of their financial assets.

A great number of CL initiatives have been the subject of research, analysis and practical application. Some of them indicated significant positive effects, but their implementation brought only partial effects. The non-systematic approach in problem-solving and neglect of other stakeholders’ interests by the local government caused the failure of many applied CL initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the CL initiatives categories sustainability, taking into consideration the goals of all stakeholder groups. This is the first paper analyzing various CL initiatives categories simultaneously, from the aspect of providers, shippers/receivers, local authorities, and residents, which is the main contribution of the paper. Twelve basic CL initiative categories were considered, while their assessment and ranking were performed with a novel hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process and fuzzy Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution, which is another contribution of the paper. The results indicate that the development and implementation of logistics centers emerge as the best CL initiative category for solving CL problems in the city of Belgrade. The theoretical implications of this article are the creation of a framework for the evaluation of the sustainability of CL initiatives, as well as the novel MCDM model that could be used for problem-solving in different areas. The practical implication of the article is the provision of a framework for decision-makers, policy-creators and practitioners for supporting the process of plans development and initiative implementation in the field of CL. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","City logistics initiative; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy MARCOS; MCDM; Sustainability","Belgrade; Serbia; analytical hierarchy process; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; logistics; multicriteria analysis; stakeholder; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122880086"

This program aims to increase energy access, meet fuel needs, empower the local economy, and encourage regional economic development. Pertamax price fluctuations are a challenge for Pertashop, which has an impact on financial stability and customer satisfaction. This research proposes a solution using accurate price predictions with deep learning models, namely Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The research results show that the LSTM and GRU models with optimal hyperparameters provide more accurate Pertamax price predictions than RNN. The analysis uses Pertamina data, crude oil prices, and the USD-IDR exchange rate from January 2016 to October 2023. The LSTM model shows the best performance with training RMSE 0.0083 and testing RMSE 0.0084, and R2 of 0.9989. This research provides valuable insight into the economic impact and sustainability of the Pertashop program at the local level, particularly in West Nusa Tenggara. It is hoped that these findings will be useful for policy makers, businesses and the public to better understand the impact of the program and potentially influence similar initiatives at the national level. © 2024 Asia Pacific Journal of Mathematics.","deep learning model; Pertamax price; Pertashop; West Nusa Tenggara Province","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199203884"

Firstly, the macro-financial environment may change due to new coercive regulations and the resulting inevitable rise in investment costs, indirectly affecting corporate solvency. Secondly, the transition costs paid directly by companies in the form of higher carbon prices may reduce their short-term earnings and hence their ability to repay their debts. These two effects modify the structure of corporate solvency, summarized in the transition matrices of corporate ratings. These matrices, calculated on a geo-sectoral scale, are used to assess potential additional credit risks due to climate scenarios, like sudden and brutal rising costs. In order to integrate climate-related effects into corporate credit risk assessment, we propose a method for assessing the effect of rising carbon price trajectories on forward-looking corporate rating transition matrices, taking into account the diffusion of risk across the geo-sectoral value chain defined with a Leontief input–output model. By way of illustration, we applied our method to US corporate rating transition matrices. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Kiel Institute for the World Economy 2024.","C67; Carbon price; Climate stress test; Climate transition risk; E22; E47; G32; Input–output models; Q54; Transition matrices; Value chain","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194182527"

To address this issue, this research article proposes a new model for optimizing urban public safety governance and crisis management by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technology with a focus on sustainability. This study aims to explore the construction and path of an urban public safety governance and crisis management optimization model integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technology in China. We developed a linear regression model to examine the relationship between public safety technologies and outcomes, with public safety outcomes (PSO) as the dependent variable and public safety governance structure (PSGS), AI-driven data collection and analysis (AIDC&A), crisis prediction and early warning system (CPEWS), AI-assisted decision-making (AIADM), and public safety response mechanisms (PSRM) as independent variables. The model summary revealed that the independent variables accounted for a moderate proportion of the variance in public safety outcomes, with an R² value of 0.5 and an adjusted R² value of 0.45. The results supported the hypothesis that the integration of different public safety technologies has a positive impact on public safety outcomes. The effective governance structure, AI-driven data collection and analysis, crisis prediction and early warning system, AI-assisted decision-making, and efficient public safety response mechanisms were all found to be crucial for enhancing public safety outcomes. The proposed model was validated through a case study in a Chinese city, with feedback from stakeholders confirming its effectiveness. Overall, the findings suggest that the urban public safety governance and crisis management optimization model integrating AI technology can significantly improve public safety management in urban areas. © 2023 by the authors.","AI-assisted decision-making; artificial intelligence (AI) technology; crisis management optimization; linear regression model; public safety outcomes (PSO); urban public safety governance","China; artificial intelligence; crisis management; decision making; early warning system; governance approach; optimization; population growth; safety","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159356748"

While modern machinery provides swift methods of integration and inbuilt predictive maintenance (PdM), older machines, while physically fully functional, are less attractive to reuse, a specific reason being their lack of ready-to-implement PdM hardware and models. More sustainable manufacturing operations can be achieved if the useable lifespan of functional older machinery can be extended through retrofittable PdM and modern industrial communication systems. While PdM models can be developed for a class (make/model) of machine with retrofitted sensing, it is often found that legacy machines will deviate greatly from their original form, through nonstandard maintenance and component replacement actions during their lengthy lifespan. This would mean that each legacy machine would require a custom PdM model, a cost often leading to the removal or nonusage of legacy machines. This paper proposes a framework designed for the generation of an efficient PdM algorithm which would allow for the reuse of legacy machines retrofitted with low-cost sensing in modern manufacturing for increased sustainability. Given a limited number of data samples collected from a machine to be maintained, we aim to predict a failure or/and maintenance time by making use of the difference between the characteristics of the variation of the healthy and unhealthy data collected from the machine. We measure the healthiness of the machine by using a Siamese network trained with a public dataset and fine-tuned with data samples obtained from machines with similar characteristics. Although we use different training and testing datasets coming from completely different sources, we obtain reasonable results thanks to the proposed technique. The results of simulations and the statistical analysis enable us to devise a transfer learning technique and a Siamese network employed for failure detection in the machine. The proposed system will allow for the continued use of older machines in modern facilities, enabling more sustainable manufacturing models. © 2023 by the authors.","deep neural network; one-shot learning; predictive maintenance; Siamese network; sustainable manufacturing; transfer learning","artificial neural network; data set; detection method; hardware; machinery; manufacturing; replacement; statistical analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164112818"

This study employs Python software for comprehensive data analysis to process and interpret large datasets efficiently. Our empirical findings robustly validate that incorporating ESG metrics significantly enhances the predictive prowess of our model, thereby elevating precision in discerning instances of financial distress. A striking feature in the process is that the chance of incorrectly identifying the distressed or defaulting firms as sound business enterprises due to the implementation of ESG is impossible. The foundation of our predictive model, bonded by a strong methodology, includes integrating various tools such as classical statistics methods and state-of-the-art new machine learning models. For a comparative analysis seven machine learning models have been employed, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting. To interpret the results, three performance parameters have been used which are sensitivity (Se), Area Under the Curve (AUC), and F1 score. Among all the models Random Forest Model stands out as the most stable model, which shows 100% accuracy in all the parameters, with and without the inclusion of ESG Scores. The implications of our work also affect the market scene, making an impact through prospective investors, policymakers, and financial parties affiliated with the forefront companies.

Utilizing predominantly Predictive Maintenance (PM) of Wind Turbines (WT), this research analyzes the potential benefits that could be generated by Wind Energy (WE) through the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This research recommends an Internet of Things-WSN model for PM comprised of three distinct phases: the primary phase is the collection of data via sensors, the second phase is the transmission of that data through a connection to the Internet, and the final phase is the implementation of data analytics on that data in the context of cloud computing. For PM analytics, this work introduces a Predictive Maintenance Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (PM-C-LSTM) model that combines the spatial pattern recognition capabilities of a Convolutional Neural Network with the sequential data prowess of LSTM networks. The PM-C-LSTM model combines CNN for recognizing spatial patterns and LSTM networks for analyzing sequential data in a way that doesn't affect the accuracy of WT-PM. A Failure Sample Generator model is also fused into the study to measure soft failure and hard failure factors and improve the predictive accuracy of the Machine Learning (ML) model. Data became available over 16 months while the model was applied to a Wind Farm (WF) positioned on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It has been demonstrated that the PM-C-LSTM model possesses enhanced PM capabilities by comparing its efficiency to other standard models using a selection of performance metrics. The result of the test indicates that there is a probability that the hybrid IoT and ML will improve PM methods in WT, which will subsequently help improve the effectiveness and sustainability of WE generation. © 2024 The Authors","Accuracy; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Renewable energy; Wind energy and turbines; Wireless sensor networks","Convolution; Data Analytics; Internet of things; Maintenance; Pattern recognition; Wind power; Wind turbines; Wireless sensor networks; Accuracy; Green energy sources; Machine-learning; Predictive maintenance; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Research analysis; Sequential data; Spatial patterns; Wind turbine systems; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186406384"

It was empirically shown here that a double-layer grid deck system in composite action with a thin layer of two−way reinforced concrete slab introduced several structural advantages over the conventional composite plate-girder superstructure system. These advantages included improved seismic performance, increased structural rigidity, reduced deck vibration, increased failure capacity, and so on. Optimally proportioned space grid superstructures were found to be less prone to progressive collapse, increasing structural reliability and resilience, while reducing the risk of sudden failure. Through a set of dynamic time-series experiments, considerable enhancement in load transfer efficiency in the transverse direction under dynamic truck loading was gained. Furthermore, the multi-objective generative optimization of the proposed spatial grid bridge (with integral variable depth) using evolutionary optimization methods was examined. Finally, comprehensive discussions were given on: (i) mechanical properties, such as fatigue behavior, corrosion, durability, and behavior in cold environments; (ii) health monitoring aspects, such as ease of inspection, maintenance, and access for the installation of remote monitoring devices; (iii) sustainability considerations, such as reduction of embodied Carbon and energy due to reduced material waste, along with ease of demolition, deconstruction and reuse after lifecycle design; and (iv) lean management aspects, such as support for industrialized construction and mass customization.

It is expected that extending sustainability to suppliers at lower tiers through effective sustainability governance approaches (SGAs) can reduce these risks for focal companies. The existing literature lacks research on decision support tools using management science techniques to help decision makers choose the most suitable SGA/SGAs in a given situation and the risk management of SGAs in multi-tier supply chain. The present study develops a model-driven decision support system (DSS) using Bayesian network (BN) that can assist operations managers in selecting the most effective SGA/SGAs in multi-tier supply chain considering each situation. The developed DSS includes contingency factors and risk variables and their relationships which are identified through a systematic literature review and is applied to the multi-tier, sustainable supply chain of a multinational company operating in China to demonstrate its practical applicability.

This study presents an early-warning framework for high-speed railway (HSR) bridge construction under extreme wind conditions, using a long-span continuous beam bridge constructed in a typhoon-prone area as a case study. Specifically, on-site wind environment measurements during a typhoon are utilized, and parameters such as fluctuating wind turbulence intensity, gust factor, turbulence integral scale, and power spectral density are employed to characterize the wind environment. Multi-step prediction of gust wind speed during the bridge construction is performed using the hybrid Back Propagation-Genetic Algorithm (BP-GA). Hierarchical warnings and control actions are proposed and implemented based on the prediction results. The analysis results of wind parameters revealed a discrepancy between the measured and specified typhoon turbulence intensities, with the windward turbulence intensity being lower than specified. The longitudinal average gust factor exceeded the transverse value. The prediction curve based on the BP-GA algorithm closely resembles the actual curve, meeting accuracy requirements. Notably, the one-step prediction provided the most accurate results. Based on the predicted wind speed trend for the upcoming half-hour, appropriate hierarchical warnings and control measures were conducted. © 2023 by the authors.","construction; early warning; extreme winds; high-speed railway bridge; machine learning; prediction","bridge construction; disaster management; early warning system; extreme event; machine learning; prediction; turbulence; typhoon; wind velocity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199234869"

The indecorous disposal of waste paves the way for huge disaster named as climate change. The National Environment Agency (NEA) of Singapore oversees the sustainable management of waste across the country. The three main contributors to the solid waste of Singapore are paper and cardboard (P&C), plastic, and food scraps. Besides, they have a negligible rate of recycling. In this study, Machine Learning techniques were utilized to forecast the amount of garbage also known as waste audits. The waste audit would aid the authorities to plan their waste infrastructure. The applied models were k-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Regressor, ExtraTrees, CatBoost, and XGBoost. The XGBoost model with its default parameters performed better with a lower Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 8.3093 (P&C waste), 8.3217 (plastic waste), and 6.9495 (food waste). However, Grid Search Optimization (GSO) was used to enhance the parameters of the XGBoost model, increasing its effectiveness. Therefore, the optimized XGBoost algorithm performs the best for P&C, plastics, and food waste with MAPE of 4.9349, 6.7967, and 5.9626, respectively.

One of the most promising and popular concepts of digitalization in the last decade is certainly the technology of the digital twin (DT). As rail transport ranks very high among transport modes in terms of sustainability, resilience and reliability, its digitalization is of great importance. Since any disruption or interruption of normal rail operations with the aim of improving conditions could have many negative consequences, the technology of DT is perfect in this sense, as it allows testing changes on a virtual copy of the real system without directly affecting its operation. Combined with machine learning and other artificial intelligence algorithms, it can also be used to predict and forecast operational characteristics, events and failures that can trigger rapid management and action and prevent disruptions and cost increases. This article, therefore, aims firstly to provide a comprehensive and overarching overview of the application of DT technology in the rail sector using a newly proposed multi-layered classification, and secondly to highlight the research gaps that need to be addressed in the near future to enable the transition to Rail 4.0. The result of this research, which examined 58 research articles published in scientific journals, shows that the application of DT in the railway sector has increased in recent years, that investigations in infrastructure for maintenance purposes receive the most attention in the scientific community, and that there is still much room for research and development of DT in the railway sector.  © 2013 IEEE.","Digital twin; DT; DT application; rail; rail DT classification; rail DT domains; rail industry; rail system; railway","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; 'current; Condition; Rail operations; Rail systems; Rail transport; Rail transportation; Railway; Real systems; Road; Transport modes; Investments","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200822522"

This will lead to improved robustness, efficiency, and eco-sustainability, as well as mitigate significant health and safety concerns regarding sudden catastrophic failure modes. Bearing degradation is the most significant cause of machine failure and has been reported to cause up to 75% of low-voltage machine failures. This paper introduces a low complexity machine learning (ML) approach to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of rolling element bearings using real vibration signals. This work explores different ML recipes using novel feature engineering coupled with various k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) kernel and weighting functions in order to optimise this RUL approach. Original non-linear wear state models and feature sets are investigated, the latter are derived from Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Hilbert Marginal Spectrum (HMS). These feature sets incorporate one-third octave band filtering for low complexity multivariate feature subspace compression. Our proposed ML algorithm stage has employed two robust supervised ML approaches: weighted k-NN and SVM. Real vibration data were drawn from the Pronostia platform to test and validate this prognostic monitoring approach. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with classification accuracy results of up to 82.8% achieved.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of employing the ConvLSTM model for spatial water level prediction. The ConvLSTM-based methodology is simpler, faster, and more accurate in predicting water levels without the need for boundary conditions or topography than standard numerical simulation methods. In addition, we take worst-case situations into account by employing the random forest model to anticipate the highest possible water increase.

Thus, the reduction of traffic fatalities or accidents is one of the contributing factors to attaining sustainability goals. Different factors such as the geometric structure of the road, a non-signalized road network, the mechanical failure of vehicles, inexperienced drivers, a lack of communication skills, distraction and the visual or cognitive impairment of road users have led to this increase in traffic accidents. These factors can be categorized under four headings that are: human, road, vehicle factors and environmental road conditions. The advent of machine learning algorithms is of great importance in analysing the data, extracting hidden patterns, predicting the severity level of accidents and summarizing the information in a useful format. In this study, three machine learning algorithms for classification, such as Decision Tree, LightGBM and XGBoost, were used to model the accuracy of road traffic accidents in the UK for the year 2020 using their default and hyper-tuning parameters. The results show that the high performance of the Decision Tree algorithm with default parameters can predict traffic accident severity and provide reference to the critical variables that need to be monitored to reduce accidents on the roads.

Compared to static node deployment strategies, dynamic node movements require properly configured cluster regions. The inability of single-point cluster head functions in random WSN conditions motivates the researchers to maintain reliable multi-level cluster heads. On the multi-level clustering needs, the existing techniques such as the Three-Tier Extended Energy Efficient Clustering Hierarchy Protocol (TEEECH), Joint Sector Shape and Minimum Spanning Tree-based Clustering Protocol (JMTEC), and Multi-Level Heterogeneous Extended Distributed Clustering Routing for Scalable WSN (ML-HEDEEC) and various techniques are implemented under various constraints. The constraints taken for multi-level clustering mechanisms are different in terms of energy optimization, connectivity optimization, secondary cluster heads, and randomness optimization. Anyhow, the insufficient node coordination and dynamic network management principles of existing schemes are considered major research problems. On this scope, the proposed Multi-Point and On-Demand Link State (MPOL) clustering algorithm is developed under the constraints of frequently hap-pening random network events (link changes, node failures, channel issues, etc.). The technical modules of the proposed MPOL clustering scheme consist of dynamic real-time network modeling characteristics, Multi-Point Relay (MPR)-based cluster head selection phases, neighbor-based Multi-Point Cluster Head Selection (MCH) phases, reliable cluster community establishment, optimized cluster connectivity management, and multi-mode data routing principles. These crucial technical aspects of the proposed model improve cluster formation, sustainability, and management in an optimized and resilient manner. At the same time, the clus-ter-supportive routing model protocol implemented in this work effectively finds the routing path under real-time failures of nodes and links. The proposed model has been experimented with along the existing models such as TEECH, JMTEC, and ML-HEDEEC using field-specific performance metrics. In this performance analysis, the MPOL clustering scheme is identified with a maximum of 12% of performance benefits in Randomized WSNs. Particularly, the clustering time complexity of MPOL is measured between 0.95 seconds and 3 seconds for maximum velocity (10 m/s).

Considering the role of social networks in customer feedback channels, one of the essential sources to examine the reflection of a product/service is social media mining. This paper aims to identify the frequent product failures through social network mining. Focusing on social media data as a comprehensive and online source to detect warranty issues reveals opportunities for improvement, such as user problems and necessities. This model will detect the causes of defects and prioritize improving components in a product-service system based on FMEA results. Design/methodology/approach: Ontology-based methods, text mining and sentiment analysis with machine learning methods are performed on social media data to investigate product defects, symptoms and the relationship between warranty plans and customer behaviour. Also, the authors have incorporated multi-source data collection to cover all the possibilities. Then the authors promote a decision support system to help the decision-makers using the FMEA process have a more comprehensive insight through customer feedback. Finally, to validate the accuracy and reliability of the results, the authors used the operational data of a LENOVO laptop from a warranty service centre and classifier performance metrics to compare the authors’ results. Findings: This study confirms the validity of social media data in detecting customer sentiments and discovering the most defective components and failures of the products/services. In other words, the informative threads are derived through a data preparation process and then are based on analyzing the different features of a failure (issues, symptoms, causes, components, solutions). Using social media data helps gain more accurate online information due to the limitation of warranty periods. In other words, using social media data broadens the scope of data gathering and lets in all feedback from different sources to recognize improvement opportunities. Originality/value: This work contributes a DSS model using multi-channel social media mining through supervised machine learning for warranty-service improvement based on defect-related discovery to unravel the potential aspects of social networks analysis to predict the most vulnerable components of a product and the main causes of failures that lead to the inputs for the FMEA process and then, a cost optimization. The authors have used social media channels like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, LENOVO Forums, GitHub, Quora and XDA-Developers to gather data about the LENOVO laptop failures as a case study. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data mining; Decision support system; FMEA; Machine learning; Social networks; Warranty service","Artificial intelligence; Customer satisfaction; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision support systems; Defects; Learning systems; Ontology; Product design; Sales; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Customer feedback; FMEA; Machine-learning; Product service; Service continuity; Service operations; Social media datum; Social media minings; Social network; Warranty service; Data mining","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147817884"

Circular Economies (CE) aim to minimize the usage of resources by utilizing the waste in production as new or raw materials. Interconnectivity between parties in the industrial system provides decision-makers with rich information and anticipation of failure. Industry 4.0 technologies (I4.0) allow for handling such issues, protecting the environment by utilizing resources efficiently, and restructuring the industry to be smarter as well. This paper contributes to achieving cleaner production (CP), CE, and social for manufacturers through the linkage between 6R methodology with new technologies of I4.0 such as Blockchain technology (BCT) and big data analytical technology (BDA). In this paper, the authors proposed a Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) decision framework based on the best-worst method (BWM), Decision-Making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), Technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS). The authors contributed to addressing the weaknesses and problems of these subjective MCDM methods through the cooperation of the neutrosophic theory with the usage of MCDM methods in this work. In the first stage, all criteria that influence sustainable manufacturer selection are specified using literature research on this topic. BWM-based neutrosophic theory was combined to get the criteria’s weights with the aid of DEMATEL-based neutrosophic to obtain the least and best criteria used in BWM in the second stage. The optimal sustainable manufacturer was selected based on TOPSIS and COPRAS under neutrosophic theory in the third and fourth stages, respectively. Furthermore, a case study performed indicated manufacturer 2 (A2 ) is an optimal sustainable manufacturer in two ranking methods otherwise, manufacturer 4 (A4 ) is the worst sustainable manufacturer. The contribution of this work is to propose a hybrid MCDM with an uncertainty theory of neutrosophic for sustainable manufacturer selection based BDA-BCT with 6R. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to show the decision’s flexibility in various scenarios. Finally, the consequences for management viewpoints were considered. © 2022 by the authors.

To solve SOFC system issues, data-driven prognostics methods based on the dynamic neural network (DNN), one of non-linear models, were investigated in this study. Based on DNN model types, the neural network autoregressive (NNARX) model with external inputs, the neural network autoregressive moving average (NNARMAX) model with external inputs, and the neural network output error (NNOE) were utilized to predict the degradation trend and estimate the RUL. First, the degradation trend prediction was executed to evaluate the correctness of the proposed DNN model structures in the first learning phase. Then, the RUL was estimated on the basis of the degradation trend of the NN models in the second inference phase. The comparison test results show the prediction accuracy of the NNARX model is higher and the RUL estimation can be given within a smaller relative error than the NNARMAX and NNOE models. The evaluation criteria of the root mean square error and mean absolute error of the NNARX model are the smallest among these three models. Therefore, the proposed NNARX model can effectively and precisely provide degradation trend prediction and RUL estimation of the SOFC system. © 2021 by the authors.

This article presents a Supply Chain Network (SCN) model that can be used to regulate downstream relationships towards a sustainable SME using a 4-component cost function structure — Environmental (E), Demand (D), Economic (E), and Social (S). As a major generalization to the existing practice of using phenomenological interrelationships between the EDES cost kernels, we propose a complementary time varying model of a cost function, based on Lagrangian mechanics (incorporating SCN constraints through Lagrange multipliers), to analyze the time evolution of the SCN variables to interpret the competition between economic inertia and market potential. Multicriteria decision making, based on an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ranks performance quality, identifying key business decision makers. The model is first solved numerically and then validated against real data pertaining to two Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) from diverse domains, establishing the domain-independent nature of the model. The results quantify how increases in a production line without appropriate consideration of market volatility can lead to bankruptcy, and how high transportation cost together with increased production may lead to a break-even state. The model also predicts the time it takes a policy change to reinvigorate sales, thereby forecasting best practice operational procedure that ensures holistic sustainability on all four sustainability fronts. © 2022 The Author(s)","Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Lagrangian mechanics; Multiple criteria analysis; Optimization; Supply chain management; Sustainable Production","Commerce; Cost functions; Costs; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Lagrange multipliers; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Analytic hierarchy process; Cost-function; Kinetic models; Lagrangian mechanics; Multiple criteria analysis; Optimisations; Small-and-medium enterprise; Supply chain network; Sustainable production; Time evolutions; Analytic hierarchy process","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138153662"

PD creates financial losses to the industry by reducing animal carrying capacity and producing poor-quality feed, resulting in diminished productivity. After more than a decade since PD first appeared in Australia, the causes and effective treatments are still unknown. Suggested causes include soil microbiota dysbiosis, pathogens, insects, climate change and overuse of chemical fertilisers. Sea minerals have been suggested as capable of improving plants’ yield, quality, taste, and nutritional value, but were never brought into conventional practice as an alternative to chemical fertilisers. Here, we investigated the capacity of sea minerals to improve grass health and yield of PD-affected soil. The replicate plots were treated with water or with 4 mL/m2 of commercially available sea mineral product to investigate the soil chemistry profile, plant morphometrics, pasture productivity, soil microbiota profile, and microbiota-nutrient interactions. Sea mineral application significantly increased total dry matter 20 weeks after a single application, translating to an additional 967 kg/ha; this benefit was still present at 498 kg/ha eleven months post a single application. Sea mineral application improved soil microbiota by boosting beneficial taxa while reducing genera associated with arid and toxic soils. Additionally, sea mineral application increased the number of grassroots up to eleven months post a single application. Our data suggest the benefits of sea mineral application to damaged, unproductive or exhausted soils could be further explored as a natural, affordable, and non-toxic alternative to chemical fertilisers. © 2022 by the authors.","dieback; grass; microbiota; pasture; sea minerals; soil; sustainability","Australia; carrying capacity; climate change; dieback; grass; grassland; morphometry; pasture; soil chemistry; soil nutrient; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142770135"

Results show that: (1) 5 aspects and 31 criteria comprise the evaluation system of homestay business, (2) the aspects and criteria with high global weight are nearly clustered into the effect group, (3) the weight of service quality and homestay geist and community co-prosperity as the rank top two, (4) more than these, hardware facilities construct the product features of homestays because of the role of driving elements, (5) owing to the core elements, criteria about operational efficiency become guiding principles of homestay business, and (6) service quality and integrated utilization of socio-cultural resources underpin the sustainable development of homestay business in the long run. Therefore, the interrelationships of aspects and criteria provide further insights and underline the focus on homestay business for practitioners.

Our experiments indicate that participating in ecological efficiency improves the evaluation system of financial distress warnings, and its accuracy is much better than the traditional evaluation system in the long run. The logit model confirms the essential of ecological indicators in financial distress warning, and the behavior of observing environmental regulation will prevent enterprises from getting into financial distress. Finally, suggestions on improving green finance and promoting technological innovation are propounded, in which technological innovation (TI) is the core of an enterprise's competitiveness, and green finance can accelerate that process. © 2021 Shuang Wu et al.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111538499"

An adaptive protection system (APS) is conventionally coordinated through a central management system located at the distribution system substation. An APS depends significantly on the communication infrastructure to monitor the latest status of the electric power grid and send appropriate settings to all of the protection relays existing in the grid. This makes an APS highly vulnerable to communication system failures (e.g., broken communication links due to natural disasters as well as wide-range cyber-attacks). To this end, this paper presents the addition of local adaptive modular protection (LAMP) units to the protection system to guarantee its reliable operation under extreme events when the operation of the APS is compromised. LAMP units operate in parallel with the conventional APS. As a backup, if APS fails to operate because of an issue in the communication system, LAMP units can accommodate a reliable fault detection and location on behalf of the protection relay. The performance of the proposed APS is verified using IEEE 123 node test system.  © 2013 IEEE.","Adaptive protection; distributed energy resources; distribution system; local adaptive modular protection; machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Disasters; Electric fault currents; Electric power system protection; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Interactive computer systems; Network security; Real time systems; Relay protection; Smart power grids; Systems engineering; Adaptive protection; Circuit faults; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Faults diagnosis; Local adaptive modular protection; Local-adaptive; Machine-learning; Modulars; Relay; Support vectors machine; Timing circuits","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133699167"

The building infrastructure sector is one of the largest global consumers of electricity and thereby one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing building energy consumption directly contributes to achieving energy sustainability, emissions reduction, and addressing the challenges of a warming planet, while also supporting the rapid urbanization of human society. Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) that are digitalized using advanced sensor technologies are a formal approach that is widely adopted to reduce the energy consumption of building infrastructure. Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocols are a repeatable and transparent methodology to evaluate and formally report on energy savings. As savings cannot be directly measured, they are determined by comparing pre-retrofit and post-retrofit usage of an ECM initiative. Given the computational nature of M&V, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be leveraged to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of M&V protocols. However, AI has been limited to a singular performance metric based on default parameters in recent M&V research. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a comprehensive AI approach for M&V protocols in energy-efficient infrastructure. The novelty of the framework lies in its use of all relevant data (pre and post-ECM) to build robust and explainable predictive AI models for energy savings estimation. The framework was implemented and evaluated in a multi-campus tertiary education institution setting, comprising 200 buildings of diverse sensor technologies and operational functions. The results of this empirical evaluation confirm the validity and contribution of the proposed framework for robust and explainable M&V for energy-efficient building infrastructure and net zero carbon emissions. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; baseline modeling; Energy Conservation Measures (ECM); energy efficiency; explainability AI (XAI); Measurement and Verification (M&V)","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Carbon; Conservation of Energy Resources; Fatigue; Humans; Physical Phenomena; Artificial intelligence; Buildings; Carbon; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Historic preservation; Retrofitting; carbon; Baseline models; Energy conservation measure; Energy conservation measures; Energy efficient; Explainability artificial intelligence (XAI); Measurement and verification; Measurement protocol; Verification protocol; Zero carbons; algorithm; artificial intelligence; energy conservation; fatigue; human; physical phenomena; Energy efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143767200"

Both rely on estimates of obligor probabilities of default (PD). Investors also pay close attention to credit ratings—derived from inter alia default rates. Changes in climate will increase firm default rates. Studies investigating the impact of climate change on PDs are limited because this is a novel field and data are still relatively scarce. Africa will be most severely impacted by climate change: default rates will deteriorate leading to increased PDs, LGDs, provision requirements (through increased expected losses) and regulatory credit risk capital (through increased unexpected losses). Corporate equity prices are simulated using Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and shocks brought about by climate events of differing frequency and severity are applied to these simulated prices. Post shock prices and return volatilities are differentially affected depending on the nature of the applied shock. These constitute inputs into a well-known model of corporate default form which resultant PDs may be extracted. A possible calibration approach is developed for climate event-based impacts on corporate default rates. A scaling factor matrix (an amount by which the unaffected default rate increases after a specified climate event type occurs) can help market participants forecast default rate changes. Climate related impacts have been quantified, calibrated, and used to assess credit quality degradation. © 2022 The Author(s).

Leather production requires large quantities of freshwater and various chemicals are added to the water at every stage of production. The absence of proper regulatory bodies and specialized treatment plants to recycle the wastewater add to the environmental hazards caused by the industry. Due to the problems cited above and the significant cost of safe wastewater disposal, numerous manufacturers illegally discharge their chemically polluted wastewater, causing immeasurable damage to the environment and public health. Governments' failure to adopt suitable taxation and subsidy policies further aggravates the crisis and discourages manufacturers from transitioning toward sustainable production practices. As a result, the majority of manufacturers are on the brink of bankruptcy. In this study, we propose a model for a leather industry supply chain that incorporates the three pillars of sustainability which include economic viability, environmental protection, and social equity. The proposed model features flexible governmental policies and enacts a Stackelberg competition between the producers and retailers under both certain and uncertain conditions in the context of the Iranian leather industry to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. To verify the applicability of the model, it was applied to a real-world case study under uncertainty.

Proper understanding of shear stress characteristics can assist in providing safer design and prevent failure in deep beams which consequently lead to saving lives and properties. In this investigation, a new intelligent model depending on the hybridization of support vector regression with bio-inspired optimization approach called genetic algorithm (SVR-GA) is employed to predict the shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams based on dimensional, mechanical and material parameters properties. The adopted SVR-GA modelling approach is validated against three different well established artificial intelligent (AI) models, including classical SVR, artificial neural network (ANN) and gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs). The comparison assessments provide a clear impression of the superior capability of the proposed SVR-GA model in the prediction of shear strength capability of simply supported deep beams. The simulated results gained by SVR-GA model are very close to the experimental ones. In quantitative results, the coefficient of determination (R2) during the testing phase (R2 = 0.95), whereas the other comparable models generated relatively lower values of R2 ranging from 0.884 to 0.941.

Then, based on the existing fund operation risks, I integrate the risk types of commercial banks, combine the characteristics of green finance business, design the green finance fund operation risk evaluation index system, initially determine the index weights through hierarchical analysis method, introduce the entropy value method to improve the index weights, and use the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to obtain the final evaluation results: in the process of green finance fund operation, internal risk is the most important risk, among which credit risk and financial innovation risk have the most significant impact; external risk is the second most important risk, among which economic risk and political risk are the most important. External risks are the second most important risks, among which economic risks and political risks are more obvious.

The essential and primary point in these countries is the manner and extent of positive exploitation of these resources. These countries are striving to achieve a high level of economic growth and prosperity. How and how much positive use of these resources is used to achieve this goal is very important. In these countries, public investment is used as a driving force for long-term growth. In the present study, we investigated the impact of public investment policies on macroeconomic variables using a general equilibrium model. The results show that, during the time, if institute and management exercises improve, public investment as an efficient capacity reduces the need for constraints. Also, if better selected, organized, and implemented investment projects, the average real return on investment will increase and, as a result, without increasing the level of debt, will have a positive effect on stock growth and income. In other words, choosing the right project will increase investment efficiency, and as a result, capital growth and macroeconomic stability will be ahead. To better examine and ensure the accuracy of the results, we look at the variables of public debt and commercial debt with further and long-term reductions in prices. Due to the decrease in the price of total public debt, foreign trade debt has increased by more than what was mentioned in the previous case. This finding confirms the economic reasoning at the efficiency level: ""Public investment in low-income countries turns half of the cost of public investment into effective public investment."" The initial level is in motion, and only with the policy of financial integration can the amount of capital be increased to some extent in the forecast horizon. The research findings generally emphasize prudent fiscal policies to reform infrastructure investment and increase productivity rather than a sudden increase in public investment. Long-term economic growth is also possible through increased productivity and financial stability. © 2021, Institute for Economic Forecasting.

During this electric transportation revolution, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a vital role in storing energy. To determine the range of an electric vehicle (EV), the state of charge and the state of health (SOH) of the battery pack is essential. Access to high-quality data on battery parameters is a crucial challenge for researchers working in the energy storage domain due primarily to confidentiality constraints on manufacturers of batteries and EVs. This paper proposes a hybrid framework for predicting the state of a lithium-ion battery for electric vehicles (EV). Electric vehicles are growing worldwide because of their environmental and sustainability advantages. Batteries are replacing fossil fuels in electric vehicles. In order to prevent failure, Liion batteries in electric vehicles should be operated and controlled in a controlled and progressive manner to ensure increased efficiency and safety. An extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is used in this paper to estimate the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. The model is subjected to error analysis to optimize the battery’s performance parameter. The model undergoes an error analysis to optimize its performance parameters. Furthermore, a state of health (SOH) estimation method based on the extreme gradient boosting algorithm with accuracy correction is proposed here to improve the accuracy of state of health (SOH) estimation for lithium-ion batteries. To describe the aging process of batteries, we extract several features such as average voltages, voltage differences, current differences, and temperature differences. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model for estimating the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is based on the ensemble learning algorithm’s higher prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Experimental results suggest that the boundary gradient lifting algorithm model is capable of more accurate prediction. © 2022 by the authors.

To ensure the sustainability of education, distance education plays a significant role. During the process of distance education, it is necessary to examine the learning situation of students. This study proposes an academic early warning model based on long and short-term memory (LSTM), which firstly extracts and classifies students’ behavior data, and then uses the optimized LSTM to establish an academic early warning model. The precision rate of the optimized LSTM algorithm is 0.929, the recall rate is 0.917 and the F value is 0.923, showing a higher degree of convergence than the basic LSTM algorithm. In the actual case analysis, the accuracy rate of the academic early warning system is 92.5%. The LSTM neural network shows high performance after parameter optimization, and the academic early warning model based on LSTM also has high accuracy in the actual case analysis, which proves the feasibility of the established academic early warning model. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

The increase of competition in the microfinance sector motivated by the entry of banks into this industry is another incentive for MFIs to implement advanced management systems. Pricing systems and credit-scoring models should contribute towards the efficiency of MFIs, thereby improving their competitiveness and self-sustainability in an increasingly constrained environment. However, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical evidence exists on the application of pricing strategies by MFIs. Therefore, this paper builds a microcredit-pricing system and determines the capital requirements inspired by the Basel III Internal-Rating Based (IRB) approach, which is underpinned by multilayer perceptron (MLP) credit-scoring. We find that the implementation of an IRB approach allows the analysed MFI to reduce its capital requirement and current interest rates by $200,000 and 30.12%, respectively. Moreover, this approach constitutes a relevant tool for the control of credit risk and the minimization of default losses. Consequently, the adoption of pricing and credit-scoring systems provides MFIs with a power management tool to compete against banks by reducing the interest rate, capital requirements, and credit losses, and therefore increases their financial self-sustainability. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","efficiency; internal rating-based approach; Microfinance institution; multilayer perceptrom; pricing; self-sustainability","artificial neural network; competitiveness; debt; microfinance; pricing policy; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116388249"

To forecast the changes in carbon emissions after the pandemic, this study analyzed the long-term relationship between the extreme events and carbon emissions since 1960, and short-term drivers of the changes in carbon emissions before and after the 2008 financial crisis. Extreme events cannot change the upward trend of carbon emission in the long run. Specifically, the extreme events (1973 oil crisis, the American Reserve Loan Association crisis, the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the Asian financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis) led to a decline in carbon emissions temporarily, however, a retaliatory rebound of carbon emission were occurred after the extreme events. The long-term relationship between extreme events and carbon emission indicate that this unfolding extreme event (COVID-19 pandemic) cannot change the trend the carbon emission, and carbon emission will be rebound after the pandemic. In addition, the decomposition results showed the main contributor to the retaliatory rebound of carbon emissions after the 2008 financial crisis was the decline in energy efficiency. The decline in energy efficiency was caused by the economic recovery plan post 2008 financial crisis, which stimulated the economy and employment at a cost of energy efficiency and environmental protection. The current economic recovery plans to deal with COVID-19 pandemic also prioritizes economic development and job creation, while ignoring energy efficiency. Therefore, the post-pandemic carbon emissions will repeat the carbon emissions after the 2008 financial crisis, i.e., there will a retaliatory rebound. To avoid the retaliatory rebound, improving energy efficiency should be included in these economic recovery plan to cope with COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","carbon rebound; energy efficiency; forecast; historical events; Post-pandemic","Coronavirus; carbon emission; COVID-19; disease spread; economic development; employment generation; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental protection; epidemic; extreme event; financial crisis; forecasting method; historical perspective","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100904114"

The issue of predicting the financial health of companies is very important in terms of their sustainability. The aim of this paper is to determine the financial health of the analyzed sample of companies and to distinguish financially healthy companies from companies which are not financially healthy. The analyzed sample, in the field of heat supply in Slovakia, consisted of 444 companies. To fulfil the aim, appropriate financial indicators were used. These indicators were selected using related empirical studies, a univariate logit model and a correlation matrix. In the paper, two main models were applied—multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) and feed-forward neural network (NN). The classification accuracy of the constructed models was compared using the confusion matrix, error type 1 and error type 2. The performance of the models was compared applying Brier score and Somers’ D. The main conclusion of the paper is that the NN is a suitable alternative in assessing financial health. We confirmed that high indebtedness is a predictor of financial distress. The benefit and originality of the paper is the construction of an early warning model for the Slovak heating industry. From our point of view, the heating industry works in the similar way in other countries, especially in transition economies; therefore, the model is applicable in these countries as well. © 2021 by the authors.

Proactive diagnosis techniques such as failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) are important for detecting all probable failures and facilitating the risk analysis process. However, significant uncertainties exist in the classical-FMEA when it comes to ranking the risk priority numbers (RPNs) of failure modes. Such uncertainties may have an impact on the food sector’s operational safety and maintenance decisions. To address these issues, this research provides a unique FMEA framework for risk analysis within an edible oil purification facility that is based on certain well-known intelligent models. Fuzzy inference systems (FIS), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM) models are among those used. The findings of the comparison of the proposed FMEA framework with the classical model revealed that intelligent strategies were more effective in ranking the RPNs of failure modes. Based on the performance criteria, it was discovered that the SVM algorithm classifies the failure modes more accurately and with fewer errors., e.g., RMSE = 7.30 and MAPE = 13.19 with that of other intelligent techniques. Hence, a sensitivity FMEA analysis based on the SVM algorithm was performed to put forward suitable maintenance actions to upgrade the reliability and safety within food processing lines. © 2022 by the authors.

A large number of them are installed using trenchless Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) technology. The aim of this work was to develop and compare new machine learning models dedicated for risk assessment in HDD projects. The data from 133 HDD projects from eight countries of the world were gathered, profiled, and preprocessed. Three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forests, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were developed to predict the overall HDD project outcome (failure free installation or installation likely to fail), and the occurrence of identified unwanted events. The best performance in terms of recall and accuracy was achieved for the developed ANN model, which proved to be efficient, fast and robust in predicting risks in HDD projects. Machine learning applications in the proposed models enabled eliminating the involvement of a group of experts in the risk assessment process and therefore significantly lower the costs associated with the risk assessment process.

The authors improve on existing sovereign pricing models by considering sovereign segmentation into developed markets, emerging markets issuing bonds in local currency, and emerging markets issuing bonds in a hard currency. By passing climate change’s economic impacts through the pricing model, the authors can assess the relative pricing impact for each security.

While previous articles in this area considered neural network analysis for large companies from primary sectors of the economy, we take the novel approach of examining the less-explored area of innovative companies. First, we complete a comprehensive review of the relevant literature in order to define the best configuration of factors which can influence bankruptcy, network architecture and learning methodology. We apply our chosen method to a sample of companies from around the world, from industries which are considered innovative, and identify the dependence of bankruptcy probability on a set of factors which are reflected in the financial data of a company. Our evaluation is based on the financial data of 300 companies – 50 of them are bankrupts, and 250 are ‘healthy’. Our results represent the set of relevant factors for bankruptcy prediction and the appropriate neural network. We have applied a total of 19 factors characterising efficiency, liquidity, profitability, sustainability, and level of innovation. Our proposed analysis is appropriate for all sizes of companies. We provided two models in order to cater for the most confidence in terms of obtained results. The total predictive ability of the model developed in our research is almost 98%, which is extremely efficient, and corre-sponds to the results of the most modern methods. Both approaches demonstrated almost the same level of influence of factor groups on final bankruptcy probability. © 2021, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

Five different winds are adopted to assess their quality over the CRE, including ERA5, CFSv2, GFS, CCMP-NRT and a newly available high resolution (9 km) wind product from APRCP (Asia-Pacific Regional Coupled Prediction System). The performance of the five winds, together with four wind input source functions is evaluated by comparing with satellite altimeter observations and multiple in-situ observations. Systemic difference is presented in the four input source functions, with the JANSSEN and KOMEN packages outperformingWST in terms of significant wave height (Hs) over the CRE. The default ST6 has comparative skill as JANSSEN during fair weather conditions but tends to predict higher Hs during extreme weather events. All winds have the tendency to underestimate the altimeter observed Hs during fair weather conditions. Part of the negative bias attributes to the overestimation of altimeter observations, while the boundary conditions only play a minor role, given a relatively large model domain extending to about 135° E. The CFSv2/GFS wind has the best performance during fair weather conditions, but overestimates the extreme wave height during typhoon events. The ERA5, on the other hand, underestimates Hs during both fair and extreme weather conditions. In terms of extreme waves, CCMP-NRT generally agrees best with observations. The high resolution APRCP behaves significantly different from other wind forcings and shows poorer performance in wave simulation. But high resolution winds have the advantage in resolving the detail wind structure and show better performance in reproducing the high frequency wave fluctuations adjacent to the CRE. In addition, the deviation due to different wind forcings is more distinct than the different input source functions. Nevertheless, given a certain wind forcing, calibrations would further improve the model performance. This study provides a good start to build a hindcast and forecast system for the CRE region. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Changjiang River Estuary; SWAN; Wave growth formulation; Wave modeling; Wind forcing","China; Yangtze Estuary; Estuaries; Forecasting; Meteorological instruments; Meteorology; Rivers; Water waves; Changjiang River Estuary; Fair weather; High resolution; Input sources; Performance; Source functions; SWAN; Wave growth formulation; Wave modelling; Wind forcing; extreme event; hindcasting; wave height; wave modeling; weather forecasting; wind forcing; Wind","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129521561"

Specifically, we match machine learning predictions of corporate carbon footprints to syndicated loans initiated in 2010–2018 and aggregate these to loan portfolios of the twenty largest banks in the United States. Banks vary in their climate transition risk not only due to their exposure to the energy sectors but also due to borrowers' carbon emission profiles from other sectors. Banks generally lend a minimal amount to coal (0.4%) but hold a considerable exposure in oil and gas (8.6%) and electricity firms (4.6%) and thus have a large exposure to the energy sectors (13.5%). We observe that climate transition risk profile was stable over time, save for a temporary (in some cases) and permanent (in others), reduction in their fossil-fuel exposure after the Paris Agreement. From the stress testing, the median loss is 0.5% of US syndicated loans, representing a decrease in CET1 capital of 4.1% when extrapolated to the whole balance sheet. The loss is twice as large in the 1.5°C scenarios (1.4%–2.1% of loan value, 12%–16% of CET1 capital) compared to the 2°C target (0.6%–1.1% of loan value, 5%–9% of CET1 capital) with significant tail-end risk (7.7% of loan value, 62% of CET1 capital). Banks' vulnerabilities are also driven by the ex-ante financial risk of their borrowers more generally, highlighting that climate risk is not independent from conventional risks. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bank risk; Climate risk; Corporate loans; Stress testing; Syndicated loans","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144112486"

Current approaches rely substantially on human engagement, making them costly and unsustainable, especially in high-volume industrial complexes like fulfillment centers. The length of time that fulfillment center equipment failures last is particularly important because it affects operational costs dramatically. A machine learning approach for identifying long and short equipment failures is presented using historical equipment failure and fault data. Under a variety of hyperparameter configurations, we test and compare the outcomes of eight different machine learning classification algorithms, seven individual classifiers, and a stacked ensemble. The gradient boosting classifier (GBC) produces state-of-the-art results in this setting, with precision of 0.76, recall of 0.82, and false positive rate (FPR) of 0.002. This model has since been applied successfully to automate the detection of long- and short-term defects, which has improved equipment maintenance schedules and personnel allocation towards fulfillment operations. Since its launch, this system has contributed to saving over $500 million in fulfillment expenses. It has also resulted in a better understanding of the flaws that cause long-term failures, which is now being used to build more sophisticated failure prediction and risk-mitigation systems for fulfillment equipment.  © 2023 Abed Mutemi and Fernando Bacao.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156214351"

In particular, an indicator for assessing the level of financial stability of business entities is proposed. The calculation of this indicator is based on a comparison of the forecast value of the flow of income of the enterprise, which it can use to fulfill its obligations to creditors, with the minimum allowable value of this flow, at which these obligations will be guaranteed to be fulfilled by the enterprise. A model for assessing the impact of debt financing of energy saving measures at enterprises on the level of their financial stability has been developed. Analytical expressions have been established for the limiting values of the part of the loan financing of energy-saving projects, under which the financial stability of the enterprise after the implementation of these projects will not decrease or will be at the minimum acceptable level. This made it possible to identify the conditions under which the introduction of investment measures at enterprises aimed at improving energy efficiency leads to an increase in the level of financial stability of business entities. These conditions provide for a limitation on the share of borrowed funds in the structure of sources of financing for energy saving projects, taking into account the forecast values of return on investment and other indicators that affect the ability of enterprises to fulfill their loan obligations in a timely manner. An empirical analysis was carried out on a sample of Ukrainian enterprises belonging to three types of economic activity. This analysis showed, in particular, that an increase in the investment activity of enterprises in the field of energy conservation has a positive impact on their level of financial stability. It was also found that the increase in the share of debt financing of energy-saving projects, to a certain extent, negatively affected the financial stability of the enterprises that implemented these projects. However, at any level of debt financing, the implementation of energy-saving projects made it possible to increase the average financial stability of the companies under study. The purpose of the article is to develop and use tools for assessing the impact of debt financing of energy saving projects on the financial sustainability of those enterprises that implement these projects. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2022.","Debt Financing; Energy Saving; Energy Saving Project; Enterprise; Financial Stability; Investment Activity","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150884893"

We inquire to what extent do markets use the dynamic evolution of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio as an indication of the likelihood of a public debt default. Specifically, our empirical research design involves the following steps: (i) we use the dynamic equation of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio to build forecasts of future values of this ratio in the eurozone countries; (ii) we then use these forecasts in a regression to see how important they are to explain the risk premium implicit in the treasury bond yields. We find that projections of future values of the public-debt-to-gdp ratio do impact current 10 year bond spreads. According to our regressions, markets seem to give more weight to forecasts with a horizon smaller than 10 years. Our results suggest that agents use a relatively simple mechanism to forecast the public debt-to-gdp ratio, a mechanism which can be used while updated forecasts from international organizations are not yet available. On the other hand, according to our estimations, euro area sovereign debt markets ceased to significantly discriminate countries based on their public debt prospects after the 2012 ‘Whatever It Takes” speech and the announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program—suggesting that these events had a significant calming effect on the markets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Public-debt-to-gdp ratio; Risk premium; Sustainability of public finances; Treasury bonds","Europe; debt; financial market; forecasting method; Gross Domestic Product; investment; monetary policy; public spending; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135835664"

Several institutions have incorporated machine learning (ML) into their patient care to improve awareness and support clinician decision-making along the perioperative spectrum. Recent research suggests that ML risk prediction can support perioperative patient risk monitoring and management across several situations, including the operating room (OR) to intensive care unit (ICU) handoffs. Objectives: Our study objectives were threefold: (1) evaluate whether ML-generated postoperative predictions are concordant with clinician-generated risk rankings for acute kidney injury, delirium, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, and establish their associated risk factors; (2) ascertain clinician end-user suggestions to improve adoption of ML-generated risks and their integration into the perioperative workflow; and (3) develop a user-friendly visualization format for a tool to display ML-generated risks and risk factors to support postoperative care planning, for example, within the context of OR-ICU handoffs. Methods: Graphical user interfaces for postoperative risk prediction models were assessed for end-user usability through cognitive walkthroughs and interviews with anesthesiologists, surgeons, certified registered nurse anesthetists, registered nurses, and critical care physicians. Thematic analysis relying on an explanation design framework was used to identify feedback and suggestions for improvement. Results: 17 clinicians participated in the evaluation. ML estimates of complication risks aligned with clinicians' independent rankings, and related displays were perceived as valuable for decision-making and care planning for postoperative care. During OR-ICU handoffs, the tool could speed up report preparation and remind clinicians to address patient-specific complications, thus providing more tailored care information. Suggestions for improvement centered on electronic tool delivery; methods to build trust in ML models; modifiable risks and risk mitigation strategies; and additional patient information based on individual preferences (e.g., surgical procedure). Conclusions: ML estimates of postoperative complication risks can provide anticipatory guidance, potentially increasing the efficiency of care planning. We have offered an ML visualization framework for designing future ML-augmented tools and anticipate the development of tools that recommend specific actions to the user based on ML model output. Statement of Significance. • Problem: Implementation of machine-learning (ML) output within clinical workflows is not trivial. • What is already known: Barriers to ML implementation and appropriate use within clinical workflows include clinicians’ limited understanding of ML, wariness of ML output, and lack of ML output actionability. • What this paper adds: Qualitative end-user evaluation of postoperative risk predictions found high-levels of agreement between rankings of clinicians' manual risk rankings and ML-augmented risk estimates. The evaluation also highlighted design (functional and visual) enhancements for translational implementation of ML models within clinical workflows. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence; Complications; Critical Care; Surgery","Critical Care; Humans; Machine Learning; Patient Care; Risk Assessment; Surgeons; Decision making; Diseases; Forecasting; Graphical user interfaces; Intensive care units; Risk assessment; Risk management; Surgery; Visualization; Care planning; Clinical workflow; Complication; Critical care; End-users; Handoff; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Postoperative complications; Risks management; acute kidney failure; aged; anesthesiologist; anesthesist; Article; artificial intelligence; clinician; controlled study; decision making; deep vein thrombosis; delirium; design; feedback system; female; health care planning; human; intensive care; intensive care unit; intensivist; lung embolism; machine learning; male; perioperative period; pneumonia; postoperative care; postoperative complication; prediction; predictive model; registered nurse; risk assessment; risk factor; risk management; surgeon; thematic analysis; total quality management; workflow; intensive care; machine learning; patient care; risk assessment; surgeon; Machine learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144010772"

The development of new technologies helps to improve the efficiency of production and the quality of products. However, for the increasingly complex production systems, operational decision making encounters more challenges in terms of having sustainable manufacturing to satisfy customers and markets’ rapidly changing demands. Nowadays, rule-based heuristic approaches are widely used for scheduling management in production systems, which, however, significantly depends on the expert domain knowledge. In this way, the efficiency of decision making could not be guaranteed nor meet the dynamic scheduling requirement in the job-shop manufacturing environment. In this study, we propose using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods to tackle the dynamic scheduling problem in the job-shop manufacturing system with unexpected machine failure. The proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm was used in the DRL framework to accelerate the learning process and improve performance. The proposed method was testified within a real-world dynamic production environment, and it performs better compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.

Characterizing extremes is difficult, as they occur rarely, arise from seemingly benign conditions, and belong to complex and often unknown infinite-dimensional systems. Such challenges render attempts at characterizing them moot. We address each of these difficulties by combining output-weighted training schemes in Bayesian experimental design (BED) with an ensemble of deep neural operators. This model-agnostic framework pairs a BED scheme that actively selects data for quantifying extreme events with an ensemble of deep neural operators that approximate infinite-dimensional nonlinear operators. We show that not only does this framework outperform Gaussian processes, but that (1) shallow ensembles of just two members perform best; (2) extremes are uncovered regardless of the state of the initial data (that is, with or without extremes); (3) our method eliminates ‘double-descent’ phenomena; (4) the use of batches of suboptimal acquisition samples compared to step-by-step global optima does not hinder BED performance; and (5) Monte Carlo acquisition outperforms standard optimizers in high dimensions. Together, these conclusions form a scalable artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted experimental infrastructure that can efficiently infer and pinpoint critical situations across many domains, from physical to societal systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","Mathematical operators; Monte Carlo methods; Personnel training; Active Learning; Bayesian experimental designs; Catastrophic consequences; Condition; Design scheme; Extreme events; Infinite-dimensional system; Rogue waves; Structural failure; Training schemes; Fracture mechanics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144260104"

Several methods of evaluating individual sources of railway system risk, ranging from human factors to inherent system failure and environmental hazards, exist in the literature. However, the lack of a hybrid technique to integrate these multiple sources of risk holistically, including their interdependent effects, as a single framework for robust, accurate, and comprehensive risk assessment can limit risk perception and risk mitigation actions. This report proposes a dynamic hybrid model (DHM) that incorporates the Bayesian convolutional factorization and elimination method as a compound aggregation of frequency and severity distributions. The DHM validates predicted risk using Bayesian expectation-maximization machine learning with evidenced-based propagation from expert knowledge and learned data. It also incorporates sensitivity analysis to improve the predicted risk further by prioritizing the hazards with the maximum impact on the estimated risk due to organization resource constraints. A railway case study in the UK revealed that risk prediction using the DHM provided a holistic view of the risk. The results showed that the quantitative risk prediction using the DHM was significantly more robust, accurate, and holistic than that of the conventional risk-assessment method based on the inherent failure rate. This research will facilitate the comprehensive development of risk-mitigation strategies, such as improvements in staff training and wiring insulation, to decrease the likelihood of train derailment caused by semi-permanent coupler failure.  © 2013 IEEE.","Bayesian factorization and elimination; expectation-maximization; railway safety; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; train derailment","Convolution; Factorization; Failure rate; Hazards; Learning systems; Maximum principle; Personnel training; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety factor; Sensitivity analysis; Systems engineering; Uncertainty analysis; Bayes method; Bayesian; Bayesian factorization and elimination; Coupler; Expectation Maximization; Railway accidents; Railway safety; Risks assessments; Risks management; Train derailment; Uncertainty; Risk assessment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125695267"

For the identified failure modes, FMEA determines risk mitigation action(s). The goal is to prevent failure and keep assets and plants running at peak performance by providing fully integrated operations, maintenance, turnarounds, modifications, and asset integrity solutions, during all phases of the asset life cycle.

First, it aims to show how to overcome some of the shortcomings of the standard risk measurement methods using value-at-risk (VaR) in the context of extreme events and propose an alternative empirical method. Second, it aims to fill the research gap in analysis of risk in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In this regard, for six daily stock indices in the MENA region, from January 3, 2005 to December 31, 2014, we employ a vine copula-based generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) method and the extreme value theory (EVT) to model the dependence between the marginal distributions of returns and forecast the VaR. Based on backtesting, we assess the efficiency of the standard risk measurement models from the following families—the exponentially weighted moving average, the historical simulation, and the GARCH. By implementing the GARCH-EVT-C-vine method in the MENA region, we find that, empirically, standard methods overestimate (underestimate) the violation ratio, implying an underestimation (overestimation) of the risk, and therefore a misallocation of the capital covering the risk. The method also provides better VaR estimates for the MENA stock markets than that of the standard methods. We also verify that the greater the openness of the capital accounts and the flexibility of the exchange rate regimes, the greater will be the conditional dependence of the MENA countries on the developed markets. Finally, the empirical method we propose has an important implication for the MENA countries in that it can be adopted by these countries to forecast VaR effectively. © 2020 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","Backtesting; Extreme value theory; MENA markets; Stock indices; Value-at-risk; Vine copula; Violation ratio","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111363641"

Reliability analysis methods are needed to be developed to provide accurate estimations of the safety levels for the complex systems and structures of today. In this paper, a novel hybrid framework for the reliability analysis of engineering systems and structures is extended to reduce the computational burden. The proposed hybrid framework is named as SVR–CFORM and consists of coupling two parts: the first is an enhanced first-order reliability method (FORM) using nonlinear conjugate map (CFORM); the second is an artificial intelligence technique called support vector regression (SVR). The conjugate FORM (CFORM) is adaptively formulated to improve the robustness of the original iterative FORM algorithm, whereas the SVR technique is used to enhance the efficiency of the reliability analysis by reducing the computational burden. The performance of the proposed SVR–CFORM formulation is compared in terms of efficiency and robustness with several FORM formulas (i.e. HL–RF, directional stability transformation method, conjugate HL–RF and finite step length) through different numerical/structural reliability examples. Results indicate that the proposed SVR–CFORM formulation is more accurate and efficient than other reliability methods. Based on the comparative analysis results, the SVR technique can highly reduce the computational costs and accurately model the response of complex performance functions, while the iterative CFORM formulation found to provide stable and robust reliability index results compared to the others reliability methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; First-order reliability method (FORM); Hybrid reliability method; Nonlinear conjugate map; Structural reliability; Support vector regression (SVR)","Complex networks; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; Iterative methods; Large scale systems; Nonlinear analysis; Numerical methods; Regression analysis; Reliability analysis; Computational burden; First order reliability methods; First-order reliability method; Hybrid framework; Hybrid reliability method; Nonlinear conjugate map; Regression techniques; Structural reliability; Support vector regression; Support vector regressions; Artificial intelligence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103961561"

Furthermore, by expanding the time window in our regression analysis, we observe that the influence of ESG and its constituents strongly varies over time.

In recent years, investors have rushed to Sustainable and Responsible Investments in response to growing concerns about the risks of climate change. Asset managers look for some assessment of sustainability for guidance and benchmarking, for instance, $30 trillion of assets are invested using some ESG ratings. Several studies argue that good ESG ratings helped to prop up stock returns during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (Lins et al. J Finance 72(4):1785–1824, 2017). The ESG score represents a benchmark of disclosures on public and private firms, it is based on different characteristics which are not directly related to the financial performance (Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, ESG reports and ratings:what they are, why they matter. https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/07/27/esg-reports-and-ratings-what-they-are-why-they-matter/, 2017). The role of ESG ratings and their reliability have been widely discussed (Berg et al. Aggregate confusion: the divergence of ESG ratings, MIT Sloan Research Paper No. 5822-19, 2019). Sustainable investment professionals are unsatisfied with publicly traded companies’ climate-related disclosure. This negative sentiment is particularly strong in the USA, and within asset managers who do not believe that markets are consistently and correctly pricing climate risks into company and sector valuations. We believe that ESG ratings, when available, still affect business and finance strategies and may represent a crucial element in the company’s fundraising process and on shares returns. We aim to assess how structural data as balance sheet items and income statements items for traded companies affect ESG scores. Using the Bloomberg ESG scores, we investigate the role of structural variables adopting a machine learning approach, in particular, the Random Forest algorithm. We use balance sheet data for a sample of the constituents of the Euro Stoxx 600 index, referred to the last decade, and investigate how these explain the ESG Bloomberg ratings. We find that financial statements items represent a powerful tool to explain the ESG score. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Associazione per la Matematica Applicata alle Scienze Economiche e Sociali (AMASES).","ESG investments; Firm performance; Machine learning","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118867710"

Trustworthiness of the systems always comes with costs. The traditional and rather costly way to understand the behavior of large scale systems is to develop powerful mathematical abstractions that allow us to condense these behaviors and to reason about them at a very abstract level. In our FWF funded project Rucon, we introduce an orthogonal, data driven, and probabilistic concept to model and reason uncertainty of the systems. In Rucon, deliberated system failures are tolerated due to the benefits of the costs and sustainability. Rucon's approach targets large scale near real-time systems like live video analytics, streaming, vehicular applications, and smart city information systems.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.","","Information use; Interactive computer systems; Large scale systems; Machine learning; Real time systems; Systems engineering; Abstract levels; Data driven; Large-scale systems; Large-scales; Machine-learning; Mathematical abstraction; Orthogonal data; Probabilistics; Tactile information; Uncertainty; Information systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117013746"

Organisations all across the globe must commit to strengthen the values as a participant in sustainable development. Financial institutions are no exception; they are also being pushed to undertake many sustainable initiatives, such as increasing socially meaningful, relevant, and sustainable projects. In addition, they may contribute to sustainable growth by enacting a green banking policy. To promote the green financing strategy, this study proposes a multi-criteria sustainable credit scoring model considering triple bottom line attributes (economic, environmental, and social) besides managerial attributes. The model is built on a novel hybrid approach that combines the fuzzy best–worst method (BWM) with the fuzzy technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). The fuzzy BWM was used to weigh factors, while the fuzzy TOPSIS was utilised to evaluate borrowers. The integration of fuzzy set theory assisted in overcoming decision-making ambiguity. An empirical analysis was performed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed model. According to the study’s findings, the most important attribute for sustainable credit scoring is environmental and social sustainability and financial sustainability. On policy implications, regulators could also use the framework as a benchmark to counsel financial institutions on how to include different sustainable criteria into their credit lending process. Furthermore, financial institutions could use the proposed technique as a part of a sustainable lending policy to identify potential borrowers engaged in sustainable business. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Fuzzy best–worst method; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Sustainability; Sustainable credit scoring","banking; empirical analysis; financial system; hybrid; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111113765"

Particularly in developing economies, the key factor behind environmental damage is conventional production and consumption. This problem can be overcome by adopting sustainable production and consumption (SPC) initiatives. But for implementation of SPC, proper knowledge of various challenges and solutions is required as in case of any failure it may lead to heavy losses. So in this research study, efforts have been put to identify various barriers in adopting SPC and various solutions to make these barriers less intense. Keeping Indian manufacturing industry in focus, total twenty-six barriers under six different heads were identified with the help of the literature and experts’ input. Fuzzy-AHP MCDM methodology has been adopted to identify the relative importance of all these barriers. As a result, it is found that Government-related barriers, Management-related barriers and Finance-related barriers are the key barriers to be focused for adopting the SPC. Further thirteen solutions either to remove the barriers or to lower the impacts of barriers were identified from the literature and experts’ input. These thirteen solutions were ranked using fuzzy-TOPSIS methodology. The final results provided the prioritised list of all twenty-six barriers and thirteen solutions, which will be helpful in understanding the concept of SPC. Further sensitivity analysis has also been done to ensure the correctness of the results obtained. The literature is full of researches focused on identification and analysis of barriers, but very few studies like ours are available, which also analyse various solutions along with barriers. This work will be helpful for government and management in making policies to promote SPC. Finally, this work will be very beneficial for all, who are focused towards SPC. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Barriers in achieving sustainable production and consumption; Circular economy (CE); Fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP); Fuzzy-the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (F-TOPSIS); Sustainable production and consumption (SPC)","algorithm; analytical hierarchy process; economic development; fuzzy mathematics; policy making; sustainability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104140189"

Therefore, the post-COVID-19 world needs to adopt the green financial system by introducing new financial instruments. In this regard, green bonds—a type of debt instrument aiming to finance sustainable infrastructure projects—are growing in popularity. While the literature does not contest their effectiveness in fighting climate change, research highlights the high level of risks and low returns associated with this instrument. This study analyzes the green bond markets in different regions with a focus on Asia and the Pacific. It aims to fill the gap in the literature by conducting a comparative study of the characteristics, risks, and returns of green bonds based on the region. The study is based on theoretical background and empirical analysis using the data retrieved from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the Climate Bonds Initiative. The empirical results are based on several econometrics tests using panel data analysis estimation methods, namely pooled ordinary least squares and generalized least squares random effects estimator. Our findings prove that green bonds in Asia tend to show higher returns but higher risks and higher heterogeneity. Generally, the Asian green bonds market is dominated by the banking sector, representing 60% of all issuance. Given that bonds issued by this sector tend to show lower returns than average, we recommend policies that could increase the rate of return of bonds issued by the banking sector through the use of tax spillover. In the era of post-COVID-19, diversification of issuers, with higher participation from the public sector and de-risking policies, could also be considered. © 2021 by the authors.

Maintenance is one of the important activities in the manufacturing process, and it requires proper attention. To decrease maintenance costs and to attain sustainable operational management, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) has become important in industries. The principle of PdM is forecasting the next failure; thus, the respective maintenance is scheduled before the predicted failure occurs. In the construction of maintenance management, facility managers generally employ reactive or preventive maintenance mechanisms. However, reactive maintenance does not have the ability to prevent failure and preventive maintenance does not have the ability to predict the future condition of mechanical, electrical, or plumbing components. Therefore, to improve the facilities’ lifespans, such components are repaired in advance. In this paper, a PdM planning model is developed using intelligent methods. The developed method involves five main phases: (a) data cleaning, (b) data normalization, (c) optimal feature selection, (d) prediction network decision-making, and (e) prediction. Initially, the data pertaining to PdM are subjected to data cleaning and normalization in order to arrange the data within a particular limit. Optimal feature selection is performed next, to reduce redundant information. Optimal feature selection is performed using a hybrid of the Jaya algorithm and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). As the prediction values differ in range, it is difficult for machine learning or deep learning face to provide accurate results. Thus, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to make decisions regarding the prediction network. The SVM identifies the network in which prediction can be performed for the concerned range. Finally, the prediction is accomplished using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In the RNN, the weight is optimized using the hybrid J-SLnO. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can efficiently predict the future condition of components for maintenance planning by using two datasets—aircraft engine and lithium-ion battery datasets. © 2022 by the authors.

This study applies a novel approach that integrates AHP with integer linear programming (ILP), to address a gap in management literature regarding the need to consider both sustainability and COVID-19 impact on project selection, with a view to avoid implementation failures. Design/Methodology/Approach. A case study approach involving experts in semiconductor manufacturing was conducted, using the Delphi method, to determine weights of various criteria, including additional new criteria associated with both sustainability and COVID-19 issues considered in the selection decision for four candidate projects. Findings. Integrated results revealed two projects to be selected (projects 1 and 3). Whilst AHP results revealed more information about the ranking of all four projects, the ILP model results complemented the findings by indicating that 2 projects (projects 1 and 3) should be selected, taking account of not only resource constraints but also sustainability issues and customer behavior towards selected projects, influenced by COVID-19 impact. Originality/Value. The value lies in not only proposing a novel framework that integrates AHP with ILP but also adding to our understanding of the importance to incorporate both sustainability and COVID-19 impacts on semiconductor industry project selection, both of which have significance for the industry in terms of maximizing implementation success for selected projects.  © 2022 Lone Seboni and Kealeboga Moreri.","","Hierarchical systems; Integer programming; Semiconductor device manufacture; Sustainable development; Case study approach; Delphi method; Design/methodology/approach; Fuzzy front end; Integer Linear Programming; Integer linear programming models; Manufacturing IS; Project selection; Selection decisions; Semiconductor manufacturing; COVID-19","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141921130"

Credit card debt that is overdue by at least six months has seen a rapid increase in the past decade in the Chinese credit card industry. The problem of delinquency in credit cards not only affects the development of credit cards but it also influences the sustainability of banks. The use of credit risk assessment is critical in providing a solid foundation upon which the credit card issuer can appropriately approve an applicant for a credit card. In previous studies, a variety of machine learning methods have been proposed to assess credit risk. However, conventional methods are viewed as shallow models and are not good at representing compositional features. Thus, this study applies a deep multiple kernel classifier as a state-of-the-art technique, which is proficient in coping with deep structure and complex data in credit risk assessment. It will support decision-makers issuing credit cards in China appropriately. The results indicate that deep multiple kernel classifier outperforms conventional and ensemble models. Credit card departments with better risk management can avoid possible bad debt, hence benefiting banks’ operations. The applications of predictive intelligence enhance the prediction of human behavior in the credit card industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Credit scoring; Deep learning; Deep multiple kernel classifier; Machine learning; Predictive intelligence","Behavioral research; Decision making; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Risk management; Compositional features; Conventional methods; Credit card industry; Credit risk assessment; Intelligence systems; Machine learning methods; Multiple Kernel Learning; State-of-the-art techniques; Deep learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109819051"

First, recovery time that considerably affects the safety, cost, and sustainability of the system is not considered in the RPN calculation.

The assessment applies to the period, 2019–2026, with the use of the data on the financial indicators for 2015–2020. Five novel structural time-series models, which have the indicators derived from Altman’s EM Z”-score model as predictors, were used, and a new conceptual framework for assessing bankruptcy risk is provided. The framework expands the applicability of credit-risk-scoring models to multiyear predictions, and it takes into account the dynamism of the transitions of the firms among Altman’s risk zones. The predictions that were obtained when the Springate and Zmi-jewski scores were applied along with the Altman Z”-scores demonstrate the fair applicability of the scores for the models that are introduced here. The results of the models were confirmed by 270 artificial neural networks and they were compared to the results of the classical time-series models. The crisis started to have a negative effect on bankruptcy risk in 2020, and this effect is expected to rise until 2023; currently, in 2022, the highest number of hotel companies may be headed for bank-ruptcy. Amelioration in the position of the companies cannot be expected before 2024; however, even in 2026, the risk of bankruptcy will remain high when compared to the pre-COVID-19 period and, thus, the surviving companies will become more fragile to any further exogenous changes. These results provide a basis for the adaption of state-supported measures and business policies in order to withstand the crisis and to ensure sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.

Therefore, in this paper, a novel incentive based fuzzy fault tree analysis (NIBFFTA) approach for restructured power system considering the influence of integrating Electric vehicles and Renewable energy resources-based hybrid wind-solar energy is presented. The approach combines the impacts of different components failure rate and the incentive Gaussian distribution effects under the inducement fuzzy fault tree atmosphere for the grid integrated Renewable energy resources and Electric vehicles configurations. In the basic fault tree analysis, the vague and inaccurate events such as system switches and low power component failures could not be identified competently. Moreover, the probability values of fault occurrences in the complete power system are not considered into account. Additionally, it is quite hard to have a precise assessment of the grid-connected wind energy power systems and EV configuration failure chances or the possibility of occurrence of undesired actions in the complete system because of data deficiency. To overwhelm these demerits, a novel incentive based fuzzy fault tree analysis based on the Gaussian distribution and fuzzy set model is recommended and used for the restructured power system considering the impact of integrating Electric vehicles and Renewable energy resources. Besides, the probability analysis of fault occurrence is also proposed to determine the impact of each basic event of the proposed system on the top event. Furthermore, the prediction analysis of fault occurrence is also done to know the effect of every basic action of the system on the top action. Whereas, prediction analysis factors for the different basic events of the proposed systems are evaluated and these can be used to obtain the real consequence of basic events on the proposed system. It is found that a novel incentive based fuzzy fault tree analysis approach is more significant and efficient than the conventional fault tree method for risk assessment of restructured power system with integrating the electric vehicles and renewable energy resources. © 2013 IEEE.","electric vehicles; failure rate; fuzzy fault tree analysis; NIBFFTA; reliability analysis; Solar energy; wind energy","Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Fault tree analysis; Gaussian noise (electronic); Outages; Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Failure rate; Fault-trees; Fuzzy fault tree analysis; Novel incentive based fuzzy fault tree analyse; Power; Power system; Power systems reliability; Reliability (engineering); Renewable energy source; Solar energy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131287571"

At the same time, neural network technology is applied to solve nonlinear data modeling. Experiments and evaluation are carried out by using the artificial neural network (ANN) evaluation model. The experimental evaluation model data obtained from the experimental evaluation model show that the prediction effect is good, which proves the effectiveness of this method. According to the data of China Banking Regulatory Commission, at the end of the third quarter of 2016, the balance of nonperforming loans of Chinese commercial banks was 1493.9 billion yuan. By the end of the third quarter of 2021, the balance of nonperforming loans of Chinese commercial banks had reached 28153.5 trillion yuan, a month on month increase of about 42.7 billion yuan. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, the domestic and foreign currency assets of Chinese banking financial institutions were 339.4 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 7.7%. This shows that the credit risk remains high, but it is still at a controllable level. Commercial banks are the center of the modern economic system. Their credit risk is very important to the stability and safe development of national economy. It is also the key factor for its own business sustainability and the protection of the interests of depositors. Therefore, effectively preventing and reducing credit risk is a key field in the financial risk management of commercial banks.  © 2022 Wei Feng and Ming Chen.","","Deep neural networks; Economics; Finance; Risk management; Business-intelligence; Commercial bank; Credit risks; Credit scoring; Economic globalization; Evaluation models; Experimental evaluation; Market volatility; Neural-networks; Third quarters; Risk assessment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131158562"

Then, monitoring the company's financial situation and predicting its future development becomes important. Assessing the financial health of business entities using various models is an important area in not only scientific research, but also business practice. Purpose of the article: This study aims to predict the bankruptcy of companies in the engineering and automotive industries of the Slovak Republic using a multilayer neural network and logistic regression. Importantly, we develop a novel an early warning model for the Slovak engineering and automotive industries, which can be applied in countries with undeveloped capital markets. Methods: Data on the financial ratios of 2,384 companies were used. We used a logistic regression to analyse the data for the year 2019 and designed a logistic model. Meanwhile, the data for the years 2018 and 2019 were analysed using the neural network. In the prediction model, we analysed the predictive performance of several combinations of factors based on the industry sector, use of the scaling technique, activation function, and ratio of the sample distribution to the test and training parts. Findings & value added: The financial indicators ROS, QR, NWC/A, and PC/S reduce the likelihood of bankruptcy. Regarding the value of this work, we constructed an optimal network for the automotive and engineering industries using nine financial indicators on the input layer in combination with one hidden layer. Moreover, we developed a novel prediction model for bankruptcy using six of these indicators. Almost all sampled industries are privatised, and most companies are foreign owned. Hence, international companies as well as researchers can apply our models to understand their financial health and sustainability. Moreover, they can conduct comparative analyses of their own model with ours to reveal areas of model improvements. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland)","artificial intelligence, neural network; automotive industry; bankruptcy prediction; engineering industry; Logistic regression","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147224931"

The fast determination of the Earthquake's (EQ's) magnitude and its location is significant in disaster management and EQ risk mitigation. These parameters can be conveyed over the Internet-of-Things (IoT) network to alleviate an EQ disaster. In this article, a deep learning model based on integrating autoencoder (AE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for a swift pinpointing of EQ magnitude and location after 3 s from the onset of the P-wave is proposed. Thus, we name it 3 s AE and CNN (3S-AE-CNN). The employed data set is observed by three stations from the Japanese Hi-net seismic network. We have trained our model on 12200 events (109.80 thousand 3-s-three-component seismic windows). The model facilitates the extraction of waveforms' significant features leading to robust estimation of the EQ parameters. The proposed model predicts the magnitude and location of EQ with errors in magnitude, latitude, and longitude that reach 0.000028, 0.0000033, and 0.0001, respectively. The EQ's parameters calculated by the proposed 3S-AE-CNN model are swiftly sent to a centralized IoT system that in turn directs the involved entity to take suitable action. The obtained results of the 3S-AE-CNN are compared to the conventional manual solution method, which represents the optimum solution mean. The 3S-AE-CNN shows an enhanced performance for the magnitude and location determination as compared with the benchmark method, which proves its effectiveness for EEWS.  © 2014 IEEE.","Deep learning; Earthquake (EQ) magnitude and location; Earthquake early warning (EEW); Internet of Things (IoT)","Benchmarking; Convolution; Deep learning; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Earthquakes; Extraction; Location; Neural networks; Risk management; Seismic waves; Auto encoders; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Earthquake early warning; Earthquake location; Earthquake magnitudes; Features extraction; Internet-of-thing.; Risks management; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115675280"

However, there is still a long way to transform current mining practices into GCSM due to many challenges hampering its implementation process. This study applied a three-phase systematic research approach to develop a decision support system to recognize and eradicate these challenges through persuasive strategic pathways. In the first phase, a combination of extensive literature review and the fuzzy Delphi method identifies 9 pathways to overcome 24 challenges divided into five broad categories. The second phase involves an integrated fuzzy decision analysis approach to rank all the challenges, explore their interrelationships, and prioritize the pathways. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is conducted for pathways prioritization against each of the five categories of challenges. The proposed system is illustrated by conducting a case study of the Chinese mining industry to verify its utility and applicability. Analysis unveiled challenges related to government and regulatory and technical and operational categories as the most critical to hamper GCSM implementation, which can be overcome through three best pathways, including low-interest loans and subsidies, cognitive development, and strict codes for newer enterprises.

The empirical analysis is focused on the dynamics of the NIKKEI 225 stock market index during the sample period from July 30, 1998, to January 24, 2022. In other words, the sample period covers both the period of the global financial crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic. The econometrics includes GARCH (1,1), GJR (1,1), and EGARCH (1,1) models. By applying GARCH family models, this empirical study also examines the long-term behavior of the Japanese stock market. The Japanese stock market is much more stable and efficient than emerging or frontier markets characterized by higher volatility and lower liquidity. The paper establishes that NIKKEI 225 index dynamics is different in intensity in the case of the two most recent extreme events analyzed, namely the global financial crisis (GFC)of 2007-2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings confirmed the presence of the leverage effect during the sample period. Moreover, the empirical results identified the presence of high volatility in the sample returns of the selected stock market. Nevertheless, the econometric framework showed that the negative implications of the GFC were much more severe and caused more significant contractions compared to the COVID-19 pandemic for the Japanese stock market. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing additional empirical evidence on the long-term behavior of the stock market in Japan, especially in the context of extreme events. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

A deep stacking predictive model was constructed using five different multilayer perceptron (MLP) sub models. The deep stacking model measured good performance (80% accuracy, 0.81 precision, 0.80 recall, 0.77 f1-score). All the individual models could not reach these performances with all the evaluation metrics used. Therefore, deep stacking was revealed to be the most suitable method for building a generalizable model to predict employability of IT graduates in the DRC.

This paper suggests a new dimension, which considers not only replacement costs and failure probabilities of components, but also adjacency of the components being replaced. We propose a model in which replacing adjacent components is often beneficial, because they can be replaced in a single replacement action. This helps minimizing costs known as overhead costs, which include the cost of sending a team to perform the replacement, the disruption to service during the replacement, and more. We propose several algorithms and AI techniques to suggest economical replacement methods. Evaluation on a real-world water transmission network shows that near-optimal solutions return a solution very fast, which is very close in terms of expected cost to the optimal solution. © 2022","Predictive maintenance; Uncertainty; Watermain defect prediction","Optimal systems; Critical systems; Defect prediction; Electrical grids; Maintenance strategies; New dimensions; Predictive maintenance; Uncertainty; Water transmission; Watermain defect prediction; Watermains; Maintenance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136646006"

Based on parameters such as temperature, pH, turbidity, KMnO4, NH4, Mn, Al and Fe, the calculation of WQI was conducted, while for the WQI prediction models, along with the mentioned parameters, O2, TOC and UV254 were additionally used. Four models were built to predict WQI with a time step of one, five, ten, and fifteen days in advance, in order to improve treatment processes of the DWTP regarding the changes in raw water quality in the Butoniga reservoir. Therefore, obtained models can help in the optimization of treatment processes, which depend on the quality of raw water, and overall, in the sustainability of the treatment plant. Results showed that the obtained correlation coefficients for all models are relatively high and, as expected, decrease as the number of prediction days increases; conversely, the number of rules, and related linear equations, depends on the parameters set in the WEKA modelling software, which are set to default settings which give the highest values of correlation coefficient (R) for each model and the optimal number of rules. In addition, all models have high accuracy compared to the measured data, with a good prediction of the peak values. Therefore, the obtained models, through the prediction of WQI, can help to manage the treatment processes of the DWTP, which depend on the quality of raw water in the Butoniga reservoir. © 2022 by the authors.","Butoniga reservoir; drinking water treatment plant; machine learning; prediction models; treatment processes improvement; water quality; water quality index","Istria; correlation; drinking water; numerical model; optimization; prediction; software; water quality; water treatment; water treatment plant","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138695838"

The chemical industry is a high-risk, high-pollution, and high-efficiency industry, that would benefit from a systematic and sustainability focused evaluation system for supplier selection. Yet, to date, few studies have conducted the necessary in-depth analysis of the characteristics of this industry from the economic, social, and environmental perspectives. Despite the many methods and models that have been proposed to resolve the sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem, no research has yet considered the different characteristics of each triple bottom line dimension. Accordingly, this paper addresses this problem by proposing a hybrid multi-method and multi-criteria decision-making framework for SSS in the chemical industry. Based on specific characteristics of the chemical industry, this study applies Fuzzy Grey Relational Analysis (FGRA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and cloud computing-entropy weight method (EWM) to analyze the economic, social, and environmental dimensions, respectively. Finally, this study integrates the evaluation results of the three dimensions using the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). The proposed approach and decision-making model can help managers of sustainable supply chains in the chemical industry to choose more sustainable suppliers, respond to market demands quickly, and maintain high competitiveness in the market.

Bearings are subjected to high loads and rapid speeds. Furthermore, metal-to-metal contact within the bearing makes it sensitive. In today's machines, bearing failures disrupt the operation of the system or completely stop the system. Bearing failures that can occur can cause enormous damage to the entire system. Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate bearing failures and to carry out a regular diagnostic examination. Various systems have been developed for fault diagnosis. In recent years, deep transfer learning (DTL) methods are often preferred in current bearing diagnosis models, as they provide time savings and high success rates. Deep transfer learning models also improve diagnosis accuracy under certain conditions by greatly reducing human intervention. Diagnosis at the right time is very important for the sustainability and efficiency of industrial production. A technique based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and two dimensional (2D) convolutional neural networks (CNN) is presented in this paper to detect fault size from vibration data of various bearing failure types. Time-frequency (TF) color scalogram images for bearing vibration signals were obtained using the CWT method. Using AlexNet, GoogleNet, Resnet, VGG16, and VGG19 deep transfer learning methods with scalogram images, fault size prediction from vibration signals was performed. Five different transfer deep learning models were used for three different data sets. It was observed that the success rates obtained varied between 96.67% and 100%. © 2022 Turkiye Klinikleri.

In particular, business leaders are adopting a new paradigm of planning, dynamic adaptive plans, which react adaptively to uncertainties by adjusting plans according to rapid changes in circumstances. However, these dynamic plans have been applied in larger-scale industries such as wastewater management in longer-range time frames. This paper follows the dynamic adaptive plan paradigm but transfers it to the technology management context with shorter-range action plans. Based on this new paradigm of risk management and technology planning, we propose a risk-adaptive technology roadmap (TRM) that can adapt to changing complex environments. First we identify risk by topic modeling based on futuristic data and then by sentiment analysis. Second, for the derived risks, we determine new and alternative plans by co-occurrence of risk-related keywords. Third, we convert an existing TRM to network topology with adaptive plans and construct a conditional probability table for the network. Finally, we estimate posterior probability and infer it by Bayesian network by adjusting plans depending on occurrence of risk events.

Supply chain finance is becoming a new way to solve the problem of difficult credit in agricultural development. As the importance of sustainability issues continues to rise, there are growing numbers of practical examples of combining agricultural supply chain finance (ASCF) with sustainability, and the attendant risks are emerging. The objectives of this study are first to construct a risk indicator system for sustainable ASCF, then to propose a fuzzy decision method that considers the confidence of decision-makers, and finally to perform a risk assessment of a credit case in the coffee bean supply chain. A combination of the neutrosophic enhanced best–worst method (NE-BWM) and combined compromise solution (COCOSO) is used to evaluate risk problems. The practicality and effectiveness of this research method is verified by a numerical simulation and a comparison with the method. The results show that the credit rating of core companies is the most important indicator. In the context of green and sustainable development, this indicator system is more suitable for the current green transformation development of agriculture and can help decision-makers scientifically and reasonably assess the risk level of ASCF. When loans are needed to transform green agriculture, this study provides new ideas for credit models for various actors in the agricultural supply chain and offers a new entry point to the issue of sustainable agricultural development. © 2022 by the authors.","combined compromise solution; credit risk evaluation; green agriculture; neutrosophic enhanced best–worst method; sustainable supply chain finance","alternative agriculture; farmers attitude; risk assessment; supply chain management; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139937907"

For enterprises, relying on past experiences and strategies to respond to such an unforeseen financial crisis is not appropriate or sufficient. Thus, there is an urgent requirement to reexamine and revise an enterprise’s inherent crisis management architecture so as to help it recover sooner after having encountered extremely negative economic effects. To fulfill this need, the present paper introduces a fusion architecture that integrates artificial intelligence and multiple criteria decision making to exploit essential risk factors and identify the intertwined relations between dimensions/criteria for managers to prioritize improvement plans and deploy resources to key areas without any waste. The result indicated the accurate improvement priorities, which ran in the order of financial sustainability (A), customer and stakeholders (B), enablers’ learning and growth (D), and internal business process (C) based on the measurement of the impact.

AEVs are sensor-driven and driverless that uses artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactions in Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) ecosystems. AEVs can reduce carbon footprints and trade energy with peer AEVs, smart grids (SG), and roadside units (RSUs). It supports green transportation vision. However, the sensor information, energy units, and user data are exchanged through open channels, and thus, are susceptible to various security and privacy attacks. Thus, AEVs can be remotely operated and directed by malicious entities that can propagate false updates to the peer nodes in IoV environment. This can cause the failure of components, congestion, as well as the entire disruption of IoV network. Globally researchers and security analysts have addressed solutions that pertain to specific security requirements, but still, the detection and classification of malicious AEVs is a widely studied topic. Malicious AEVs exhibit an anomaly behavior that differentiates them from normal AEVs, and thereby, the detection of anomalous AEVs and classification of anomaly type is required. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, the survey presents a systematic outlook of AI techniques in anomaly detection of AEVs. A solution taxonomy is proposed based on research gaps in the existing surveys, and the evaluation metrics for AI-based anomaly detection are discussed. The open challenges and issues in AI deployments are discussed and a case study is presented on anomaly classification through a weighted ensemble technique. Thus, the proposed survey is designed to guide the manufacturing industry, AI practitioners, and researchers worldwide to formulate and design accurate and precise mechanisms to detect anomalies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","anomalous classes; anomaly detection; artificial intelligence; autonomous electric vehicles; deep learning; machine learning; reinforcement learning","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous vehicles; Carbon footprint; Electric automobiles; Privacy by design; Renewable energy resources; Surveys; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle-to-grid; Ensemble techniques; Evaluation metrics; Green transportations; Manufacturing industries; Renewable energy source; Security and privacy; Security requirements; Sensor informations; Anomaly detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107761290"

To do so, hybrid machine learning algorithms comprised of natural language processing, fuzzy logic, and support vector regression have been constructed. This study emphasizes the significance of qualitative information on investors’ subjective consideration, the decision-making process, and causality on exchange rate volatility. To perceive the causality of expected and unexpected macroeconomic news on exchange rate fluctuations, news regarding the inflation rate, interest rate, unemployment rate, balance of trade, and credit ratings has been extracted from the web. Learning automata has been adopted to construct a unique lexicon for textual analysis. Subjective considerations of decision makers based on news have been evaluated by processing using the prospect theory and composing fuzzy antecedents for the fuzzy logic phase. The fuzzy logic method attained the correlation value between the macroeconomic news and the exchange rate. Finally, support vector regression predicted the exchange rate on a daily basis.

This research paper focuses on estimating the remaining useful life of a nanocomposite-based fabricated capacitor using various experimental and artificial intelligence techniques. Accelerated life testing is used to explore the sustainability and remaining useful life of the fabricated capacitor. The acceleration factors affecting the health of capacitors are investigated, and experiments are designed using Taguchi’s approach. The remaining useful lifetime of the fabricated capacitor is calculated using a statistical technique, i.e., regression analysis using Minitab 18.1 software. An expert model is designed using artificial neural networks (ANN), which warns the user of any upcoming faults and failures. The average remaining useful life of the fabricated capacitor, using accelerated life testing, regression, and artificial neural network, is reported as 13,724.3 h, 14,515.9 h, and 14,247.1 h, respectively. A comparison analysis is conducted, and performance metrics are analyzed to opt for the most efficient technique for the prediction of the remaining useful life of the fabricated capacitor, which confirms 93.83% accuracy using the statistical method and 95.82% accuracy using artificial neural networks. The root mean square error (RMSE) of regression and artificial neural networks is found to be 0.102 and 0.167, respectively, which validates the consistency of the reliability methods. © 2021 by the authors.

In this regard, jobsites and laydown yards that involve construction materials such as gravel piles and crushed rocks could be the main sources of potential windborne debris during extreme wind events. To analyze safety risk and predict the damage imposed by jobsite debris to nearby built environments, a new computer vision-based risk assessment based on geometric digital twins of jobsite debris is proposed for the reliability analysis on glazing systems of dwellings located on nearby jobsites. The impact of a gravel pile in a railroad jobsite on nearby buildings and residential environments was studied based on extreme wind event scenarios, and the failure risk of the building glazing system was computed. The risk associated with jobsite debris during extreme wind events and their impact on neighboring communities are analyzed through three computing modules: (1) satellite imagery-based terrain modeling to study 3D characteristics of the at-risk built environment; (2) analyzing visual data from Google Street View to assess the risk associated with glazing panels of dwellings in the communities; and (3) analyzing visual data from a jobsite to quantify the impact of jobsite debris, to associate its safety risk to neighboring communities. The proposed method can provide an immediate heads up for those who reside nearby jobsites, allowing to take required preemptive actions to protect their habitation against potential windborne debris. Practitioners will also be informed of such jobsite debris-related risk before extreme wind events to better secure their jobsites for the risk mitigation.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","3D modeling; Damage detection; Debris; Deep learning; E-learning; Gravel; Housing; Landslides; Piles; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Seismology; Built environment; Extreme winds; Glazing systems; Gravel pile; Job sites; Safety risks; Vision based; Visual data; Wind events; Windborne debris; Reliability analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137717664"

Since uncertainty is an integral part of disaster conditions, the research problem formulates the fuzzy robust stochastic optimization model under the hybrid uncertainty. Then, a real-world case study is studied in Golestan province, Iran. Afterward, transportation risks are calculated by adopting the fuzzy failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) method, and then the proposed model is solved by a hybrid algorithm based on the multi-choice goal programming method and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO).

Some argue that if the Basel III global capital rules treated environmentally friendly assets as being safer forms of capital, banks would be incentivized to hold more of these assets on their balance sheets and extend more green debt, promoting sustainable investment.This paper explores the possible impacts of this reform by combining firm-level environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data with a global general equilibrium model. It finds that the reform would result in a significant reallocation of capital, goods, and services across sectors and economies. It finds that while the reform could significantly increase investment, the investment is not necessarily sustainable and not all countries benefit from cooperation.The paper identifies a range of challenges that need to be overcome for these results to hold, including the reliability of ESG data, inconsistencies in taxonomies and methodologies, and further analysis confirming whether green firms are indeed safer borrowers.The paper argues that the G20 is well placed to address these challenges and outlines an agenda to achieve it. © The Author(s) 2023.

Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been widely utilized, they have rarely been used for land cover classification of complex landscapes. This study proposed the prior knowledge-based pretrained DCNNs (i.e., VGG and Xception) for fine land cover classifications of complex surface mining landscapes. ZiYuan-3 data collected over an area of Wuhan City, China, in 2012 and 2020 were used. The ZiYuan-3 imagery consisted of multispectral imagery with four bands and digital terrain model data. Based on prior knowledge, the inputs of true and false color images were initially used. Then, a combination of the first and second principal components of the four bands and the digital terrain model data (PD) was examined. In addition, the combination of red and near-infrared bands and digital terrain model data (43D) was evaluated (i.e., VGG-43D and Xcep-43D). The results indicate that: (1) the input of 43D performed better than the others; (2) VGG-43D achieved the best overall accuracy values; (3) although the use of PD did not produce the best models, it also provides a strategy for integrating DCNNs and multi-band and multimodal data.

We performed a scientometric review of the structure and global trends of the dynamic association among oil prices and financial assets, based on research from 1982 to 2022 (September) using techniques such as the analysis of (i) sources, (ii) authors, (iii) documents, and (iv) cluster analysis. A total of 746 bibliographic records from Scopus and Web of Science databases were analyzed to generate the study’s research data through scientometric networks. The findings indicate that the most promising areas for further research in this field are represented by co-movement, copula, wavelet, dynamic correlation, and volatility analysis. Furthermore, energy markets and assets related to sustainable finance emerge as crucial trends in investigating dynamic co-movements with oil prices. They also suggest a research gap in analyzing by means of machine learning, deep learning, big data, and artificial intelligence for measuring dynamic co-movements among oil prices and assets in financial and energy markets, especially in emerging countries. Thus, these methodologies can be implemented in further research because these methods could more robustly quantify the association among such variables. The analysis provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature and research trends on the dynamic association among oil prices and financial assets. It also promotes further studies in this domain.

This, together with restrictive regulations, results in the replacement of critical components in initial stages of degradation, as well as a lack of data on advanced stages of degradation. This paper proposes a hybrid model-based approach (HyMA) to overcome the lack of failure data on a HVAC system installed in a passenger train carriage. The proposed HyMA combines physics-based models with data-driven models to deploy diagnostic and prognostic processes for a complex and critical system. The physics-based model generates data on healthy and faulty working conditions; the faults are generated in different levels of degradation and can appear individually or together. A fusion of synthetic data and measured data is used to train, validate, and test the proposed hybrid model (HyM) for fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) of the HVAC system. The model obtains an accuracy of 92.60%. In addition, the physics-based model generates run-to-failure data for the HVAC air filter to develop a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model, the RUL estimations performed obtained an accuracy in the range of 95.21–97.80% Both models obtain a remarkable accuracy. The development presented will result in a tool which provides relevant information on the health state of the HVAC system, extends its useful life, reduces its life cycle cost, and improves its reliability and availability; thus enhancing the sustainability of the system. © 2021 by the authors.

These countries can try to import grains to enhance secure food security, but this will strain their dollar reserve and endanger their financial stability. Under such circumstances, the adoption of sustainable grain storage practices is essential to reducing the unusual gap between grain production and grain availability. This research, therefore, explores the key factors that may affect the stability of stored grains to promote agricultural sustainability and food security in emerging economies. First, the study identifies the significant factors that influence the stability of stored grains from an emerging economy perspective. Then, the study employs an integrated approach consisting of Pareto analysis, fuzzy-based Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM), and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) analysis. Based on the literature review and expert feedback, nineteen factors were initially identified. After employing Pareto analysis, the top thirteen factors have been further analyzed using fuzzy TISM- fuzzy MICMAC to examine their interrelationships. The study findings indicate that “Proper training on advanced storage operations” is the most significant factor influencing sustainable grain storage operations. The study insights can help practitioners to focus more on the crucial aspects of the grain storage operation and can assist the policymakers and industry leaders of emerging economies in strategic decision-making to achieve agricultural sustainability and thus improve food security. © 2023 The Author(s)","Agricultural sustainability; Emerging economy; Food security; Fuzzy total interpretive structural modeling; Sustainable grain storage","COVID-19; Decision making; Factor analysis; Food storage; Food supply; Grain (agricultural product); Sustainable development; Agricultural foods; Agricultural sustainability; Emerging economies; Food security; Fuzzy total interpretive structural modeling; Grain storage; Interpretive structural models; Storage operations; Stored grains; Sustainable grain storage; Stability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158837916"

Accurate forecasting coupled with past operational experiences potentially enables pre-event control, aiming to reduce the impact on the system in a network with finitely large numbers of automatic and manually operated control devices. Impacts to the critical infrastructure facilities, also known as critical loads (CLs), are minimized when a Section of the network is appropriately deenergized before the event strikes. However, predictions are not perfect, and given limited accuracy with ever-changing weather forecasts, control actions are required to be constantly updated until the event has passed. Once the events are predicted with high enough confidence and the necessary reconfiguration strategy has been identified, the operator must configure the manually operable switches significantly ahead of event landfall to ensure the operational crews' safe return from potentially hazardous zones. Given limited resource availability and requisite manual switching operations, some of the loads would also have to be deenergized. Overall resiliency of the system will be improved if the loads remain connected through remotely operable switches until minutes before the event makes landfall. The proposed two-stage control framework with a necessary mathematical formulation facilitates the same. Furthermore, the proposed framework enables continuous corrective action based on available lead time. The developed proactive control framework is demonstrated using a modified IEEE 123-Node system model and a real-world isolated μ-grid based on the Cordova Electric Cooperative system with superior performance results. © 2013 IEEE.","Critical loads; distribution system resiliency; extreme events; optimization; proactive restoration","Electric power system control; Critical load; Distribution system resiliency; Distribution systems; Extreme events; License; Optimisations; PD control; Proactive restoration; Resilience; Resource management; Weather forecasting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135761587"

In this sense, the importance of the manufacturing sector lies in the fact that it is a sector that transforms raw materials into value-added consumer products, generates employment due to its high concentration of labor and exploitation of resources, and is one of the main supports for investment and development of other sectors of the economy. Predicting possible bankruptcies for companies is a topic of interest within financial analysis. Its main objective is to set in action certain actions that will avoid the probability of finding oneself in a critical scenario. Predicting the financial sustainability of a company in the short or long term is not an easy task; it is necessary to consider multiple variables, from the structure, the sector in which it operates, the economic activity to which it is dedicated and even the dynamics of a market. One of the methods developed for predictive studies is the Altman ZScore Model. This method seeks to identify, through the calculation of various financial ratios, the financial health of a company. This research was based on a financial analysis and bankruptcy forecast of anonymous companies in the manufacturing sector in the province of Azuay in Ecuador. It was shown that these companies maintain a good level of assets, sales and profits. However, eight economic activities at risk were identified, where the Wood Products Manufacturing activity is located as one of the most susceptible to bankruptcy. Therefore, these eight activities should implement corrective actions to reduce costs. © 2021.

Recently, the deep learning models for PD detection have been used to diagnose the PD fault of facilities and cables. Most PD studies have been conducted in the field, such as gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and power cables for high voltage transmission networks. There are few studies of PD fault detection for on-site low-voltage distribution networks. Additionally, there are few studies of PD detection algorithms for improving the accuracy of the deep learning models using small real PD data only. In this study, a PD online detection system and a model for long-term operational sustainability of on-site low voltage distribution networks are proposed using convolutional neural network (CNN) transfer-learning. The proposed PD online system makes it possible to acquire as many real PD data as possible through continuous monitoring of PD occurrence. The PD detection accuracy results showed that the proposed CNN transfer-learning models are more effective models for obtaining improved accuracy (97.4%) than benchmark models, such as CNN and support vector machine (SVM) using only small real PD data acquired from PD online detection system. © 2021 by the authors.

In circumstances that there is more than one facility on a specific level, they can be prioritized by different means such as multi-criteria decision-making or risk assessment techniques. In evaluating facilities with each method, some criteria might not be addressed appropriately, so combining these methods can produce a satisfactory answer. In this study, the performance level of each collection center regarding the sustainability of their performance and the risk associated with their operations in a reverse steel supply chain is evaluated. For this aim, the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, Fuzzy Analytic Network Process, and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution have been integrated.

Therefore, electric vehicles (EVs) have become a popular alternative in today’s transportation system as they have zero emissions, save energy, and reduce pollution. One of the most significant problems with EVs is an inadequate charging infrastructure and spatially and temporally uneven charging demands. As such, EV drivers in many large cities frequently struggle to find suitable charging locations. Furthermore, the recent emergence of deep reinforcement learning has shown great promise for improving the charging experience in a variety of ways over the long term. In this paper, a Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (STMARL) (Master) framework is proposed for intelligently public-accessible charging stations, taking into account several long-term spatio-temporal parameters. When compared to a random selection recommendation system, the experimental results demonstrate that an STMARL (master) framework has a long-term goal of lowering the overall charging wait time (CWT), average charging price (CP), and charging failure rate (CFR) of EVs. © 2022 by the authors.","destination; electric vehicle; electronic vehicle charging; intelligent recommendation system; smart city; smart tourism","ecotourism; electric vehicle; smart city; sustainability; tourism; tourist destination; transportation system","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146002255"

Due to its impact on organization's competitive power, researchers have proposed models to measure social performance in supply chains. However, most of these researches reveal shortcomings once encountering the cases with a huge number of criteria due to their complex computations. In order to fill this gap, this study proposes a new soft computing multi-criteria interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy distance to ideal solution approach based on interval-valued Pythagorean closeness which performs outstandingly in cases with a high fluctuation in the number of criteria. A new mechanism is defined to distinguish the weak performing social factors through supply chains by classifying them into four categorize based on their performance and distance to the best performing factors. This approach is unique in the sense that it both covers a remarkable amount of uncertainty and eases the computational processes of the previous multi-criteria decision making approaches by modifying the steps to select the most ideal solution. The feasibility and applicability of this approach have been validated by applications to a numerical case and comparative analysis. © 2021","Corporate social responsibility; Interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets; Social sustainability; Supply chain management; Sustainable development","Decision making; Failure (mechanical); Soft computing; Supply chains; Comparative analysis; Competitive power; Complex computation; Computational process; Multi criteria decision making; Social performance; Social sustainability; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100699608"

Probabilistic relationships between failure causes are revealed qualitatively and quantitatively utilizing a Fuzzy Bayesian Network approach. Following that scenario, sensitivity and validation analyses are carried out to increase the accuracy of findings. Results of the research indicate that when external and internal causes exist together then the probability of bankruptcy occurrence appears with the highest percentage. This supports the research body suggesting that an integrated approach is a more powerful approach in explaining the causes of the bankruptcy than internal or external causes do separately. It is also observed that compared to the external factors, internal causes are found to more contribute to a bankruptcy of a container liner firm.

Because the dropout phenomenon is complex and involves numerous factors, to reverse it would involve a comprehensive approach through interventions aimed at the factors identified as key in the decision to drop out. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to determine the profile of students who enter the EPN (STEM higher-education institution) to analyze the characteristics that differentiate students who drop out early in their career and those who stay in school. A sample of 624 students who accessed the EPN leveling course (a compulsory course at the beginning of their studies) participated in the study. A total of 26.6% of the participants were women. A total of 50.7% of the participants passed the course. Data referring to social, economic, and academic variables were analyzed. Comparison techniques, as well as artificial neural networks, were used to compare characteristic profiles of students who passed the leveling course and those who dropped out. The results showed significant differences between the profiles of the students who passed and those who dropped out with regard to the variables related to previous academic performance and motivational and attributional aspects. The artificial neural networks corroborated the importance of these variables in predicting dropout. In this research, the key variables predicting whether a student continues or leaves higher education are revealed, allowing the identification of students at possible risk of dropping out and thus promoting initiatives to provide adequate academic support and improve student retention. © 2022 by the authors.","academic achievement; academic motivation; causal attributions; dropout; higher education","academic performance; higher education; prediction; student; sustainability; university sector","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137900293"

This scheme handles both the allocation and energy-cost in a balanced manner through deterministic task offloading. In particular, resource allocation solution for non-delay tolerant green IoT applications is focused by confining the failures of discrete tasks through neural learning. The dropout process augmented with the learning process improves the feasible conditions for resource handling and task offloading among the active IoT service providers. Through extensive simulations the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed and energy consumption, failure rate, processing, and completion time metrics are used for a comparative study.

According to Industrial Development Report, the manufacturing sector contributes one in six jobs globally. Since the financial crisis of 2008, there has been increased debate on maintaining sustained growth (Dubey et al., 2015). Food manufacturers have been shifted into the position whereby they have to deal with recent trends of high and volatile commodity prices, transportation and energy cost. For example, ""transportation systems are essential to sustenance of human life and business growth. At the same time, they are also source of several negative impacts on human life and their environment. Therefore, they should be effectively controlled to achieve the socio-economic environmental objectives of sustainability"" (Sayyadi and Awasthi, 2018a). Consequently, the urge to gain competitive advantages while staying commited to the quality and healthy margins is getting stronger. Demand forecasting can be an advantage or a drawback to a company. Especially, when the products have short-life cycle, it is complicated for transportation, storage and quality management; therefore, an accuracy forecasting would schedule for production planning to avoid later obstacles. Based on the assessment of the financial and logistics information of the Puratos Grand-Place Indochina, five different forecasting techniques including ARIMA, Exponential smoothing, GM(1,1), DGM(1,1) and Verhulst are employed, and their results are evaluated. The results indicate that DGM(1,1) has the best performance with the smallest error. The second best methods were the GM(1,1) and Verhulst. This result strongly supports the claim that Grey Forecasting Models can deal with small, limited and violated sequences of data input. In addition, since the forecast values show small differences from the actual values; if proper investigation can be done on this matter, it would create a huge impact on the company performance for having an accurate prediction of future events. © 2019 KIIE.","Cacao; Forecasting Models; Grey System; Optimizing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085141948"

One of the modeling components is the loss-given default (LGD): it represents the credit loss for a bank when extreme events occur that influence the obligor ability to repay his debts to the bank. Among researchers and practitioners the use of statistical models such as linear regression, Tobit or decision trees is quite common in order to compute LGDs as a forecasting of historical losses. However, these statistical techniques do not seem to provide robust estimation and show low performance. These results could be driven by some factors that make differences in LGD, such as the presence and quality of collateral, timing of the business cycle, workout process management and M&A activity among banks. This paper evaluates an alternative method of modeling LGD using a technique based on advanced credibility theory typically used in actuarial modeling. This technique provides a statistical component to the credit and workout experts’ opinion embedded in the collateral and workout management process and improve the predictive power of forecasting. The model has been applied to an Italian Bank Retail portfolio represented by Overdrafts; the application of credibility theory provides a higher predictive power of LGD estimation and an out-of-time sample backtesting has shown a stable accuracy of estimates with respect to the traditional LGD model. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","actuarial techniques for finance; basel 2; credibility theory; credit risk modeling; loss-given default forecasts; quantitative finance; rating model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893178764"

Our paper, analyses the recent economic and financial crisis and its effects on sustainability transitions, and establishes a new indicator for progress in renewable electricity transitions in the context of Europe's 2020 targets. It therefore extends the ‘sustainability as a luxury’ debate to include renewable energy. The analysis reveals an ambivalent picture of the role of wealth in renewable energy transitions (RET) in Europe. Indeed, driven by the EU's common renewable energy targets, the findings suggest that RETs are promoted both because, and in spite of the means. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Austerity; Double crisis; Economic crisis; EU; Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Renewable energy","Europe; alternative energy; climate change; comparative study; economic growth; electricity industry; energy planning; European Union; financial crisis; qualitative analysis; renewal policy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021133714"

We estimate a modified DCC model with exogenous variables (DCCX), which allows for exogenous variables to impact the behavior of the DCC over time.

It has been extended to a time-varying measure that provides additional information on when and how the exposure's impact varies over time for cohort studies. However, there is no estimation procedure for PAF using data that are collected from population-based case-control studies, which, because of time and cost efficiency, are commonly used for studying genetic and environmental risk factors of disease incidences. In this article, we show that time-varying PAF is identifiable from a case-control study and develop a novel estimator of PAF. Our estimator combines odds ratio estimates from logistic regression models and density estimates of the risk factor distribution conditional on failure times in cases from a kernel smoother. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance that can be estimated empirically from the data. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimator performs well in finite sample sizes.

Computational capabilities are unable to keep abreast of the subsequent processing requirements. Thus, a means of establishing computable prognostic models to accurately reflect process condition, whilst alleviating computational burdens, is essential. This is achievable by restricting the amount of information input that is redundant to modelling algorithms. In this paper, a variable clustering approach is investigated to reorganise the harmonics of common diagnostic features in rotating machinery into a smaller number of heterogeneous groups that reflect conditions of the machine with minimal information redundancy. Naïve Bayes classifiers established using a reduced number of highly sensitive input parameters realised superior classification powers over higher dimensional classifiers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, generic parameter capabilities were evidenced through confirmatory factor analysis. Parameters with superior deterministic power were identified alongside complimentary, uncorrelated, variables. Particularly, variables with little explanatory capacity could be eliminated and lead to further variable reductions. Their information sustainability is also evaluated with Naïve Bayes classifiers, showing that successive classification rates are sufficiently high when the first few harmonics are used. Further gains were illustrated on compression of chosen envelope harmonic features. A Naïve Bayes classification model incorporating just two compressed input variables realised an 83.3% success rate, both an increase in classification rate and an immense improvement volume-wise on the former ten parameter model. © 2018, The Author(s).","big data; classification; data compression; Fault diagnosis; variable clustering","Big data; Computer aided diagnosis; Condition monitoring; Data compression; Factor analysis; Failure analysis; Harmonic analysis; Machinery; Amount of information; Bayes classification; Classification rates; Computational burden; Computational capability; Confirmatory factor analysis; variable clustering; Variable reductions; Classification (of information)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060597368"

The assessment of the energy potential of OWTs for specific offshore sites is the key factor that defines their successful implementation, commercialization and sustainability. The data used for this assessment mainly refer to wind speed measurements. However, the data may not present homogeneity due to incomplete or missing entries; this in turn, is attributed to failures of the measuring devices or other factors. This fact may lead to considerable limitations in the OWTs energy potential assessment. This paper presents two novel methodologies to handle the problem of incomplete and missing data. Computational intelligence algorithms are utilized for the filling of the incomplete and missing data in order to build complete wind speed series. Finally, the complete wind speed series are used for assessing the energy potential of an OWT in a specific offshore site. In many real-world metering systems, due to meter failures, incomplete and missing data are frequently observed, leading to the need for robust data handling. The novelty of the paper can be summarized in the following points: (i) a comparison of clustering algorithms for extracting typical wind speed curves is presented for the OWT related literature and (ii) two efficient novel methods for missing and incomplete data are proposed. © 2019 by the authors.

In the literature, different performance metrics such as time, distance, and energy were proposed for route planning of multi-robot teams. These metrics are essential for efficient operation of multi-robot team. Besides, reliability is very important for reducing risk of failures during any mission. Robot failure is an undesired event for long-term autonomous operation of the robot team. Reliability metric can be used in MRRP to forecast the risk even before it occurs and so it defines novel proactive strategy for sustainability of multi-robot team autonomy. In this study, reliability-based MRRP method is proposed. The proposed approach consists of two algorithms that are route set construction (RSC) and route set analysis and selection (RAS). The RSC algorithm is responsible for constructing route sets for any specific mission. The RAS algorithm analyses route sets considering reliability values of robots and calculates probability of route completion (PoRC) for each route in the set. Then, the most reliable route is selected as the one with the highest PoRC value. The proposed approach is applied to the MRRP problem to show the effect of the robot reliabilities on planned routes. To the best of author's knowledge, this article is among the first few articles on MRRP considering reliability of the robots. © 2019 Acta Press.

In recent years, it is becoming evident that a waste treatment technique, which ignores social aspects, is doomed to failure. The most commonly used social indicators are: number of jobs created, level of social acceptance, public knowledge, public health etc. The most of them are qualitative and measuring the sustainability and quantifying the social dimension of sustainability are difficult tasks. This paper presents the application of fuzzy logic for evaluating the social indicator—level of social acceptance. The fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic were used to develop a model for the evaluation of level of social acceptance, due to the lack of data, uncertainties, and qualitative character of indicators and also to provide effective way to include knowledge and gained experience on the process. A questionnaire was applied as instrument for data collection. The fuzzy model was verified using the city of Niš as a case study. The results obtained using the developed fuzzy model, shows that the highest level of social acceptance in the city of Niš is for recycling (57.47 %) and the lowest level of social acceptance is for incineration (17.74 %). The presented study suggests an innovative methodology for evaluation of level of social acceptance of certain waste treatment based on fuzzy logic approach and can be used for ranking of waste management scenarios in the sustainability assessment. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set theory; Social acceptance; Waste treatment","Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Waste incineration; Fuzzy logic approach; Innovative methodologies; Management scenarios; Social acceptance; Social dimensions; Social indicators; Sustainability assessment; Treatment techniques; Waste treatment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973616642"

Such systems driven by hub motors (in wheel motors) encounter previously defined and undefined faults under operation. It may inevitably lead to the interruption of the electromechanical system operation; hence, economic losses take place at certain times. Therefore, in order to maintain system operation sustainability, the motor should be precisely monitored and the faults are diagnosed considering various significant motor parameters. In this study, the artificial feedforward backpropagation neural network approach is proposed to real-time monitor and diagnose the faults of the hub motor by measuring seven main system parameters. So as to construct a necessary model, we trained the model, using a data set consisting of 4160 samples where each has 7 parameters, by the MATLAB environment until the best model is obtained. The results are encouraging and meaningful for the specific motor and the developed model may be applicable to other types of hub motors. The prosperous model of the whole system was embedded into Arduino Due microcontroller card and the mobile real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis system prototype for hub motor was designed and manufactured. © 2016 Mehmet Şimşir et al.","","Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Electric Power Supplies; Electronics; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks (Computer); Automobile manufacture; Failure analysis; Feedforward neural networks; Losses; Low power electronics; Neural networks; Sustainable development; Compact structures; Electromechanical systems; Fault diagnosis systems; Feedforward backpropagation neural networks; MATLAB environment; Real time monitoring; Real time monitors; System operation; algorithm; artificial neural network; computer simulation; electronics; human; machine learning; power supply; theoretical model; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956874945"

The model is based on genetic algorithms and allows one to obtain thresholds for the prediction of slope failures using dates of landslide activations and rainfall series. It can be applied to either single landslides or a set of similar slope movements in a homogeneous environment. Calibration of the model provides families of optimal, discretized solutions (kernels) that maximize the fitness function. Starting from the kernels, the corresponding mobility functions (i.e., the predictive tools) can be obtained through convolution with the rain series. The base time of the kernel is related to the magnitude of the considered slope movement, as well as to the hydro-geological complexity of the site. Generally, shorter base times are expected for shallow slope instabilities compared to larger-scale phenomena. Once validated, the model can be applied to estimate the timing of future landslide activations in the same study area, by employing measured or forecasted rainfall series. Examples of application of GASAKe to a medium-size slope movement (the Uncino landslide at San Fili, in Calabria, southern Italy) and to a set of shallow landslides (in the Sorrento Peninsula, Campania, southern Italy) are discussed. In both cases, a successful calibration of the model has been achieved, despite unavoidable uncertainties concerning the dates of occurrence of the slope movements. In particular, for the Sorrento Peninsula case, a fitness of 0.81 has been obtained by calibrating the model against 10 dates of landslide activation; in the Uncino case, a fitness of 1 (i.e., neither missing nor false alarms) has been achieved using five activations. As for temporal validation, the experiments performed by considering further dates of activation have also proved satisfactory. In view of early-warning applications for civil protection, the capability of the model to simulate the occurrences of the Uncino landslide has been tested by means of a progressive, self-adaptive procedure. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been performed by taking into account the main parameters of the model. The obtained results are quite promising, given the high performance of the model against different types of slope instabilities characterized by several historical activations. Nevertheless, further refinements are still needed for application to landslide risk mitigation within early-warning and decision-support systems. © Author(s) 2015.","","Calabria; Italy; calibration; climate prediction; decision support system; genetic algorithm; hydrological modeling; landslide; simulation; slope failure; uncertainty analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936851554"

This method has been applied by numerous industries to achieve an efficient maintenance process, but many have not fully completed their goals. The reason for this failure is that RCM implementation is complex, and organisations need to have adequate preparations before they implement it. In the pre-implementation phase, it is necessary to know the number of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) as a critical measure for implementing the RCM method successfully. Therefore, it is important for practitioners to apply a symmetric mechanism involving fuzzy systems to achieve the desired RCM implementation. There are a limited number of studies that have observed these factors regarding the characteristics of oil and gas companies, especially in the pre-implementation phase. Addressing RCM pre-implementation issues is of high importance from the economic perspective of sustainability for oil and gas organisations. The objective of this study is to investigate significant items in RCM pre-implementation through a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses. The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) method is applied by gaining the opinion of experts to determine the factors and prioritising them using mathematical modelling. A group of related experts from the oil and gas industry were initially interviewed and surveyed to determine the critical success factors. These identified factors were then analysed using quantitative analysis to identify the important degrees and scored using Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP). Fifteen major factors affecting the criticality of successful RCM implementation have been identified and prioritised, based on their weights. The model proposed in this study could be used as a guideline for assessing CSFs in other countries. To apply the proposed model in different contexts, it needs to be modified according to the needs, policies, and perspectives of each country. © 2020 by the authors.","Critical success factors (CSFs); Fuzzy analytic network process (FANP); Nominal group technique (NGT); Oil and gas industry; Reliability centred maintenance (RCM)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092449446"

Selection of a suitable strategy for mitigation of the risks associated with offshore renewable energy projects is a very complex and critical task. The aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) approach, based on Chang's extent analysis, in order to select the ""most appropriate risk mitigation strategy"" for offshore wind farms. Our proposed model consists of four possible alternatives (variation of offshore site layout, improvement of maintenance services, upgrading the monitoring systems, and modification in design of wind turbines) among which the decision maker has to select the best strategy according to four comparison criteria: safety, added value, cost and feasibility.

The conventional signal processing methods are less productive due to the involvement of various noises from different sources in the vibration signal, and therefore, recently fault diagnosis approaches use the artificial intelligent techniques along with the signal processing methods. Thus, motivated by the kurtogram and convolutional neural network (CNN), a novel efficient method for the fault classification of rotating machines is proposed in this paper. Kurtogram is a measure of dispersion for time–frequency energy density which provides additional frequency contents information and as an effect represents a pattern of each fault uniquely. Thus, it inspires to utilize the kurtogram as an input feature vector, and it helps in reducing the task of identifying dominant features to represent the different faults. Hence, this 2D distinct feature vector presented to CNN for fault classification. The various levels of kurtogram are examined by tuning different hyperparameters of CNN to achieve a good feature set for decent performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively classifies the bearing faults under different operating conditions in comparison to other methods. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convolution neural network (CNN); Fault classification; Kurtogram; Rolling element bearings (REBs)","Condition monitoring; Convolution; Failure analysis; Fuzzy neural networks; Processing; Roller bearings; Rotating machinery; Signal processing; Vibration analysis; Artificial intelligent techniques; Convolution neural network; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Different operating conditions; Fault classification; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Kurtogram; Rolling Element Bearing; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058055148"

We show that primary surpluses this large and persistent are rare. In an extensive sample of high- and middle-income countries there are just three (non-overlapping) episodes where countries ran primary surpluses of at least 5 per cent of GDP for 10 years. Analyzing a less restrictive definition of persistent surplus episodes (primary surpluses averaging at least 3 percent of GDP for five years), we find that surplus episodes are more likely when growth is strong, when the current account of the balance of payments is in surplus (savings rates are high), when the debt-to-GDP ratio is high (heightening the urgency of fiscal adjustment), and when the governing party controls all houses of parliament or congress (its bargaining position is strong). Left wing governments, strikingly, are more likely to run large, persistent primary surpluses. In advanced countries, proportional representation electoral systems that give rise to encompassing coalitions are associated with surplus episodes. The point estimates do not provide much encouragement for the view that high-debt European countries will be able to run a primary budget surplus as large and persistent as officially projected. © 2016 CEPR, CESifo, Sciences Po.","","Europe; debt crisis; economic growth; electoral system; financial crisis; Gross Domestic Product","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963500347"

Evaluating and choosing the sustainable-supplier for manufacturing services with lowest risks among candidates in the sustainable-supply chain management (S-SCM) is a vital issue for logistics managers, particularly by considering different sustainable criteria via three dimensions of the sustainability for strategic decisions. This paper introduces a new failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) model based on multi-criteria decision-making by a group of supply chain-experts with interval-valued fuzzy (IVF) setting and asymmetric uncertainty information concurrently. In fact, the proposed model evaluates and ranks the suppliers according to their risks of economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Concepts of mean, variance, and skewness are introduced into the proposed FMEA model, and their mathematical relations are presented based on fuzzy possibilistic statistical concepts. Then, new definitions in the FMEA are presented for obtaining ideal solutions under uncertain conditions with possibilisic mean and possibilistic standard deviation, along with the possibilisic cube-root of skewness. Also, novel separation measures, max- and min-indices, and new fuzzy ranking index for risk scoring are presented to provide order of sustainable-supplier candidates under risky conditions. Finally, a real case study for manufacturing services is given and solved by the proposed FMEA model to demonstrate its capability in the S-SCM environment. The results of the proposed model illustrate that sustainable suppliers have been assessed and selected with the least amount of risks according to three dimensions of the sustainability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA); Fuzzy possibilistic mean-variance-skewness; Interval-valued fuzzy sets; Manufacturing services; Multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM); Sustainable-supplier selection","Failure modes; Fuzzy sets; Higher order statistics; Manufacture; Risk assessment; Risks; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Failure mode and effects analysis; Interval-valued fuzzy sets; Manufacturing service; Multi criteria group decision making; Possibilistic mean; Sustainable supplier selections; Decision making","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038118244"

Such a continuous-valued index can be used to track the varying magnitude and dynamics of financial stress in the country over time. The FSSI provides an ordinal measure of stress in the financial system. Changes in the FSSI are useful in assessing whether financial stress is rising or falling, and in ascertaining extreme events in the financial system. The paper, then, objectively identifies extreme stress periods in the financial system based on movements of the index. We recognise that such extreme/tail events pose special econometric challenges as they are rare events but with a big impact. Hence, we use a more robust and analytically sound technique of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to identify extreme events in the financial system. Once the extreme stress events are identified, we use a binary dependent variable model (logit model) to estimate the impact of various macroeconomic and financial variables on the probability of extreme stress in the financial system. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","early warning systems of financial crises; Exchange market pressure; Extreme Value Theory; financial sector stress; peak-over-threshold approach","India; banking; early warning system; econometrics; extreme event; financial crisis; financial system; macroeconomics; stock market","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960282125"

Hence, this paper argued that there is a need to sustain both public and private higher education. Financial difficulties restrict private higher education from balancing their budget and maintain a balance between a quality education and maximization of shareholders wealth. This paper outlines and analyzes a critical business model for higher education institutions, Dhofar University and Majan College, both of which are publicly traded in Muscat Securities Market. Both the educational institutions are critically examined from profitability, liquidity, long term solvency and asset management perspective using appropriate financial ratios. Five year forecasts of financial statements up to 2021 are estimated to evaluate the financial stability of the two educational institutions. The paper uses Monte Carlo simulation technique to examine the issue of financial sustainability. Overall the finding shows positive financial results for Majan College compared to Dhofar University. The key take away from the analysis is that educational institutions should be funded primarily by equity and not by debt to survive, sustain and provide high quality education. © Sami Al Kharusi, Sree Rama Murthy Y., 2017.","Financial ratio system; Financial sustainability; Higher education institutions; Publicly traded; Simulation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034859107"

The more is the interdependence among the countries via the exposure to common macroeconomic factors, the higher will be the effect of the contagion. In this present context of globalization, rise of BRICS economies in the global stage demands special attention because BRICS epitomizes a tectonic shift of global economic power away from the developed countries towards the developing world. The formation of BRICS has been essential for achieving sustainable global economic growth. But the question is to what extent is BRICS vulnerable to these contagious shock waves. The present paper in this context analyzes the issue by building up an empirical model which essentially highlights the consequences of financial crises in the new millennium and their impact on BRICS. The spotlight then shifts to the theoretical foundations of the crises. Section 3 draws attention to the economic impacts of these financial crises on BRICS economies. In particular, we highlight the effects of the East Asian crisis during 1997-1998, 2007-2008 US sub-prime mortgage market crisis and the recent Eurozone crisis along with the associated implications. The econometric analysis performed in Sect. 4 marks off the significant factors accountable in this regard.

This article proposes an integrated framework to convert weather forecast into appropriate information for preventive operation during hurricanes so that the power outages induced by hurricanes can be reduced. To achieve this goal, first, a structural model of the transmission towers is developed to estimate failure probabilities based on the wind speed. These probabilities are then integrated within a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment framework to guide preventive operation. The resulting day-ahead schedule will be more reliable as it will rely less on the elements that are likely to fail. Simulation studies, conducted on the IEEE 118-bus system affected by synthesized Irma and Harvey hurricanes, showed that the proposed framework was able to prevent 33% to 83% of the blackouts. Further research is required to investigate the impacts of flooding, damage to the distribution network, and weather forecast uncertainty.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Dynamic structural modeling; extreme events; hurricane; power outage; power system reliability; power system resilience; preventive operation; stochastic optimization; transmission outage","Electric power transmission; Hurricanes; Weather forecasting; Wind; Failure Probability; Forecast information; Forecast uncertainty; IEEE 118-bus system; Integrated frameworks; Security constrained unit commitment; Structural modeling; Transmission tower; Outages","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090972008"

Using both the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the bootstrap simulations to estimate the parameters of these extreme value distributions in the left and right tails separately, we find that the empirical distributions of conventional stock markets are characterized by a fat-left tail behaviour, which implies high probability of price drops during a financial crisis, and by a right-tail characterized by a truncation. This finding implies the existence of an upper bound on possible profit during an extreme event. The empirical distribution of the Islamic market is characterized by a thin-left tail behaviour, implying moderately low probability of price drops during a financial crisis, and by a right-tail without truncation implying large probability of positive returns during an extreme event. We divide our sample period into three equal sub-periods in order avoid the impact of outliers and structural breaks. The results in each sub-period remain the same and also suggest that for all stock returns the BMM method performs better than the POT method, and that the Islamic stock market is less risky than the conventional stock markets during extreme events. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Expected shortfall; Extreme value distributions; Tail risk; Value at risk","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956698886"

In this paper, the following main research problem was addressed: How can the Asset Purchase Programme help the European Central Bank fulfill its mandate of supervising the financial stability and financial development? Based on this, we formulated the main objective: to identify the impact of monetary policies on the dynamics of financial markets development, labor markets, and the markets for goods and services. As part of the applied methodology, the impact of the quantitative easing on the government bond yields curve was based on an indirect assessment using the seemingly unrelated regression model, considering the use of parameters from the functional benchmark form. Through the vector error correction model, another additional impact of the application of the monetary policy mechanisms on selected indicators of the considered markets was identified. The relationship between financial markets and economic growth was determined on the basis of the two-stage least square model using endogeneity control instruments. Applying the changes identified by the above models allowed us to determine the expected change in the rate of growth of the aggregate output of the euro area countries. Based on our results, we found out that Asset Purchase Programme had an impact on the growth of government bond yields issued by euro area countries, on lowering the risk rate on corporate bond markets, and increasing the nominal value of shares. In addition, growth in inflation and a decline in interest rates were affected.

The main result is that the time between extreme events plays an important role in the statistical analysis of these events and could therefore be useful to forecast the size and intensity of future extreme events in financial markets. We illustrate this point by measuring the impact of the subprime and global financial crisis on the German stock market in extenso, and briefly as a benchmark in the US stock market.

The corporate bankruptcy risk-return association is well founded in the literature. However, there is a dearth of empirical research on how this association prevails at different stages of the corporate life cycle. The present study aims to investigate the bankruptcy-risk relationship at different stages of corporate life cycle by employing Hierarchical Linear Mixed Model (HLMM) regression estimation on the data of listed non-financial Pakistani firms from 12 diverse industrial segments. We grouped the firms into introduction, growth, mature, shake-out, and decline stages of the life cycle using Dickinson's model. Empirical results assert that corporate risk-taking at the introduction stage yields superior financial performance in the future, while risk at the growth stage positively contributes to a firm's current performance. Moreover, because of risk-averse and non-diversified managerial behavior, bankruptcy risk at the mature stage is negatively associated with both current and future performance. Likewise, risk-taking at the decline stage has significant negative implications for firm performance as the managers of such firms undertake heavy investments in a turnaround attempt; however, owing to the risk-averse behavior, they may indulge in negative net present value (NPV) projects. The study findings imply that managers synchronize a firm's risk exposure with the corresponding life cycle stage to avoid going bankrupt. Moreover, excessive risk-taking during the mature and decline stages can considerably harm the financial sustainability of an enterprise.

It marks the first attempt to leverage data on corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) to better predict credit risk in an ML context. Even though the literature on default and credit risk is vast, the potential explanatory power of CSI for firm credit risk prediction remains unexplored. Previous research has shown that CSI may jeopardize firm survival and thus potentially comes into play in predicting credit risk. We find that prediction accuracy varies considerably between algorithms, with advanced machine learning algorithms (e. g. random forests) outperforming traditional ones (e. g. linear regression). Random forest regression achieves an out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 89.75 % for adjusted R2 due to the ability of capturing non-linearity and complex interaction effects in the data. We further show that including information on CSI in firm credit risk prediction does not consistently increase prediction accuracy. One possible interpretation of this result is that CSI does not (yet) seem to be systematically reflected in credit ratings, despite prior literature indicating that CSI increases credit risk. Our study contributes to improving firm credit risk predictions using a machine learning design and to exploring how CSI is reflected in credit risk ratings. © 2020, Duncker and Humblot GmbH.

This process can be measured by the entropy of the parking and forwarding of the signal, leading to a sustainable supply chain system. The dynamics of this system are governed by differential equations. Using this entropy model, we verified the integrated supply chain health manufacturing system risk failure reduction via simulation. Our method employs a fuzzy Kalman filter, improves the system, reduces backorders and demonstrates that RFID viscosity is an effective means to this end.

In this paper, we show that indicators and tests to assess government solvency should not be used alternatively. We lay out a simple and intuitive procedure to integrate simultaneously the results from the two approaches to fiscal sustainability. Indicators are forward looking, for they are based on published forecasts, thus reacting to a set of current and expected future conditions in fiscal-policy making. Tests, by contrast, are backward looking, for they are based on a sample of past data. In the event of conflicting results, indicators may signal the occurrence of a structural change in policy, which may reverse the predictions of tests. Whether the results from indicators or from tests should be given priority in the assessment of the sustainability of public debt will thus depend on the structural stability of the historical data generating process of the primary surplus. Only in the absence of a structural break in the stance of fiscal policy, the potential warning predictions of fiscal indicators should be interpreted as merely reflecting transitory factors to be eventually reversed. An application to U.S. post-World War II historical data, from 1948 to 2016, and forecasts, from 2017 to 2027, demonstrates the empirical relevance of the proposed comprehensive approach and helps add new insights to the evaluation of the U.S. fiscal position. In particular, our results suggest that the potentially unsustainable course of U.S. fiscal policy from 2008 onwards, advocated by the use of fiscal indicators, reflects systematic—not cyclical—factors. The main policy implication is that deficit increases in the U.S. from 2008 onwards cannot be regarded as a transitory phenomenon and hence do entail an urgent need for a structural change in the future stance of budgetary policy. © 2019 The Society for Policy Modeling","Fiscal indicators; Fiscal sustainability; Structural change; Tests of government solvency","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076518936"

Design/methodology/approach: Closed-ended real estate funds (CEREFs) are one of the biggest segments of unlisted private equity funds in Germany. CEREFs have a central “profitability promise” that is based on ex ante forecasts given in the prospectus. Typically, equity is tied to these investments for up to 20-30 years, leaving investors highly insecure whether their expectations will be fulfilled and fund managers actually achieve prospected performances ex post. Findings: The performance variance analysis of all German CEREFs outstanding during the global financial crisis reveals that prospect-performance disclosures as well as prospect-performance variances cause substantial problems in Germany due to overestimation biases of many fund managers. Research limitations/implications: As typical for the recent scholarly debate, also the past disclosure practice in Germany prohibits a long-term performance analysis, unless researchers apply instruments of modern investment analysis like comprehensive financial plans (“Visualisation of Financial Implications)”. Practical implications: The transparency developments in CEREF-reporting of the last decade deliver precise recommendations regarding the internal and external performance variance analysis, risk-profiles and stress tests for the future fund management. Social implications: The introduced methodology would increase transparency in the segment of CEREF and, thus, improve investor protection. Since private households in Germany mainly acquire these funds, this is a contribution to sustainability in private asset management. Originality/value: The paper develops a new methodological framework for performance measurement of unlisted funds. It then assesses for the first time the impact of transparency and trust on fund performances by applying a performance variance analysis. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Performance disclosure; Performance variation analysis; Prospectus underwriting; Real estate private equity; Unlisted funds; Visualization of financial implications (VoFis)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042558139"

However, in the financial domain expert-based credit risk models have still been dominating. Establishing meaningful benchmark and comparisons on machine-learning approaches and human expert-based models is a prerequisite in further introducing novel methods. Therefore, our main goal in this study is to establish a new benchmark using real consumer data and to provide machine-learning approaches that can serve as a baseline on this benchmark. We performed an extensive comparison between the machine-learning approaches and a human expert-based model-FICO credit scoring system-by using a Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data. As the SCF data is non-synthetic and consists of a large number of real variables, we applied two variable-selection methods: the first method used hypothesis tests, correlation and random forest-based feature importance measures and the second method was only a random forest-based new approach (NAP), to select the best representative features for effective modelling and to compare them. We then built regression models based on various machine-learning algorithms ranging from logistic regression and support vector machines to an ensemble of gradient boosted trees and deep neural networks. Our results demonstrated that if lending institutions in the 2001s had used their own credit scoring model constructed by machine-learning methods explored in this study, their expected credit losses would have been lower, and they would be more sustainable. In addition, the deep neural networks and XGBoost algorithms trained on the subset selected by NAP achieve the highest area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.","Automated credit scoring; Decision making; Internet bank; Machine learning; Sustainability","algorithm; assessment method; banking; benchmarking; comparative study; credit provision; decision making; empirical analysis; expert system; hypothesis testing; Internet; machine learning; methodology; sustainability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060971991"

Rapid developments in this kind of economic environment threaten and restrain the sustainability of enterprises. Enterprises need to respond quickly to these burdens and threats to survive and sustain their operations efficaciously in a competitive market in the long run. In order to reduce possible uncertainties in the future and to anticipate economic crises, early risk warning systems should be developed. However, it is seen that management accounting researches are very limited or insufficient on the demand of enterprises for coping with such crises. The aim of this study is to diminish the deficiency in the strategic cost management and prediction of economic crises. Sustainable Balanced Scorecard (SBSC), which was developed as a strategic cost management tool, is constructed in a dynamic way by integrating the early warning system developed for enterprises with an innovative approach into SBSC. Additionally, early warning system model is developed in a manner that successfully predicts economic crises with long short time memory (LSTM) networks using economic macro variables in micro field. As a result of the integration of risk early warning system with SBSC, economic crises will be predicted and necessary strategies will be developed to cope with problems of the crises. Furthermore, predicting economic crises will be turned into opportunities or cause enterprises to make measures with minimum losses. In this model, crisis periods are successfully predicted two crises of 2002 and 2008 with 95.41% accuracy with macroeconomic data between 1998 and 2011. © 2013 IEEE.","early warning system; economic crises; long short time memory (LSTM); machine learning; Sustainable balanced scorecard (SBSC)","Learning systems; Sustainable development; Balanced scorecards; Competitive markets; Early Warning System; Economic crisis; Economic environment; Innovative approaches; long short time memory (LSTM); Management accounting; Long short-term memory","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081678625"

Empirical findings are accomplished by applying a three phase analysis of SWOT, an integrated model of DEMATEL-ANP (DANP), and fuzzy TOPSIS. Empirical findings from the SWOT analysis suggest a total of twelve factors, which are then incorporated to formulate four strategies. The DANP results illustrate that opportunities dimension has the highest impact and strengths has the lowest among others.

The aim of the article is to find out the features of value of bank assets and to develop recommendations for assessing financial risks based on mathematical methods for forecasting economic processes. Theoretical and empirical research methods were used to achieve the aim. The article reveals the features of mathematical modeling of economic processes related to asset pricing in a volatile market. It was proved that using financial mathematics in banking contributes to the stable development of the economy. Mathematical modeling of the price dynamics of financial assets is based on a substantive hypothesis and supported by an adequate apparatus of fractal pair pricing models in order to reveal specific market relations of business entities. According to the authors, the prospects of using forecast models to minimize the financial risks of derivative financial instruments are positive. The authors concluded that the considered methods contribute to managing financial risks and improving forecasts, including operations with derivatives. Besides, the studied fractal volatility parameters proved the predictive power regarding extreme events in financial markets, such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers investment bank in 2008. The relevance of the article is due to the fact that the favorable investment climate and the use of modern financing methods largely depend on the effective financial risk management. © 2018 Finance: Theory and Practice.

However, because of the low thermal conductivity and strong adhesion characteristic, DD5 is difficult to machine and the research on this field is still blank. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the material machining mechanism and optimize the milling performance. Based on the DD5 metallographic structure characteristics, the directional cutting method was proposed firstly. Then, considering the wear characteristic and failure mode of the tools with different coating materials, the milling tool proper selection was executed. Moreover, combining with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, slot milling experiments, and slip system theory, the best milling path was confirmed. In addition, considering the machining environmental sustainability, the milling performances acquired under the dry, minimal quantity lubrication (MQL) and water-based MQL conditions were evaluated and compared. Finally, in order to optimize the machining parameter sequence quantitatively and ascertain the milling and cooling interactive effect mechanism, response surface method (RSM), back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), and uniform design experiments were all adopted. With the anticipation to improve environmental sustainability and milling performance simultaneously, the milling experiments on the DD5 (001) crystal plane along the [110] crystal direction under the water-based MQL technology with PVD-TiAlN-coated tools were conducted and the parameters of main spindle linear speed vc = 20 m/min, tool feed per tooth f = 8.97 μm, oil flow rate Q = 68.21 ml/h, the ratio of water and oil R = 0.94 and the air pressure P = 1.79 bar were used.

We present a new operational framework, Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground based measurements-AgricuLtural EaRly warning sysTem (TAMSAT-ALERT), which aims to provide early warning for meteorological risk to agriculture. TAMSAT-ALERT combines information on land-surface properties, seasonal forecasts and historical weather to quantitatively assess the likelihood of adverse weather-related outcomes, such as low yield. This article describes the modular TAMSAT-ALERT framework and demonstrates its application to risk assessment for low maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale). The modular design of TAMSAT-ALERT enables it to accommodate any impact or land-surface model driven with meteorological data. The implementation described here uses the well-established General Large Area Model (GLAM) for annual crops to provide probabilistic assessments of the meteorological hazard for maize yield in northern Ghana (Tamale) throughout the growing season. The results show that climatic risk to yield is poorly constrained in the beginning of the season, but as the season progresses, the uncertainty is rapidly reduced. Based on the assessment for the period 2002-2011, we show that TAMSAT-ALERT can estimate the meteorological risk on maize yield 6 to 8 weeks in advance of harvest. The TAMSAT-ALERT methodology implicitly weights forecast and observational inputs according to their relevance to the metric being assessed. A secondary application of TAMSAT-ALERT is thus an evaluation of the usefulness of meteorological forecast products for impact assessment. Here, we show that in northern Ghana (Tamale), the tercile seasonal forecasts of seasonal cumulative rainfall and mean temperature, which are routinely issued to farmers, are of limited value because regional and seasonal temperature and rainfall are poorly correlated with yield. This finding speaks to the pressing need for meteorological forecast products that are tailored for individual user applications. © Author(s) 2018.","","Ghana; Northern Region [Ghana]; Tamale; Zea mays; agriculture; crop yield; decision support system; early warning system; environmental risk; land surface; maize; meteorological hazard; rainfall; risk; risk assessment; satellite data; temperature","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048875154"

The survey sample was composed of 478 CEO and 561 senior managers in Vietnamese private enterprises. The results indicate that 84% of the surveyed leaders agreed with much longer time to tender economic recovery. Besides, forecasted leadership and management performance were just at moderate level, under 3.25 on the average. Struggling with challenges of recession, the leaders recognized some necessary adjustments and adaptations in which business environment becomes increasingly complex and unpredictable and requires greater flexible leaderships. Especially, amongst the 14 factors, sustainability, working enthusiasm and willingness to take risk appear to be more responded in what leaders should do in times of economic downturn. Meantime, it also can be concluded from the survey of senior manager about leader's needed competences that all values are under 4.0, which means no leadership competencies or skills is evaluated as good or excellent. © the author(s).","Leader; Leadership; Private enterprises; Vietnam","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899712747"

One method of saving energy in manufacturing systems is reducing the idle times of machines, which are non-value-added activities but consume non-negligible energy. Based on real-time data of manufacturing systems, this paper proposes a fuzzy control method to switch a machine into sleep/off mode when the idle state is about to arise and turn the machine on when production has to be resumed. A basic control module of a manufacturing system is described, considering stochastic failure of machines. The fuzzy rules for energy-saving operation are presented by analysing the buffer levels of machines based on production knowledge. Simulation studies are carried out to validate and illustrate the effectiveness of the method both for serial and parallel manufacturing systems. The proposed fuzzy control method is a simple and preferable way to achieve the energy-saving operation of unreliable manufacturing systems. © 2019 DAAAM International Vienna.

The control of risks in information technology projects will produce higher investment returns. In order to analyze as well as regulate various project threats, the establishment for a smart risk assessment framework is beneficial. It improves the traditional project management systems as well as associated protocols that are available today by offering an autonomous process for verifying predicted outcomes. This allows for the contrast that poses solutions according to each system with relevant questions and empirical data related to threats defined within major information technology projects. Current methods provide us with an assessment process to determine the likelihood for the outcomes of information technology project's targets even before the project has been initiated. In this paper we used a method to the implementation of a risk assessment paradigm for information technology projects using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) strategy. An example of an effective means of addressing such problems is given through the use of ANN as a quantitative method (e.g., the correlation / likelihood assessments). In other terms, we demonstrate how pre and post likelihood predictions through ANNs will eventually be extracted using empirical data. The method suggested in this paper were verified by computer modeling for the reliability of framework. In addition, this paper showed how project management and risk mitigation parameters, like time and costs, effect the progression and outcomes of an information technology project development. ANNs were selected as these models imparts statistical evaluation that reveal hidden relationships to the input data. The major benefits of using ANNs are versatility in regards to interpretation including resilience on the sample dataset. It was found that this tool was able to produce appropriate measures by exploiting both pre project and post project data. © 2019 SERSC.","Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Framework; Information technology project; Risk Management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081732478"

Each Board Committee must do its part in ensuring the company adopts a robust framework around sustainability. Equally important to reporting on sustainability issues and measuring and managing sustainability risk, is measuring and analysing a company’s sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Key Board Committees all need to understand the impact global macro systemic risks can have on the company and the impact the company can have on externalities which can affect its sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Boards need to ensure that every strategic decision is made through a sustainability lens. Not only will this enhance its societal impact but can be a key driver of performance. A strategic focus on sustainability at the Board level can be a source of competitive advantage. Boards need to measure and understand their sustainability ‘reputational footprint’ and benchmark themselves against their peers. Using big data and artificial intelligence, a corporate Board could integrate sustainability data into its business model and strategic decisions to give it a competitive advantage vs its peers. Boards need to have sufficient fluency in the latest sustainability technology to apply advanced statistical, data-driven information to optimise their sustainability ‘reputational footprint,’ which lowers their cost of capital and improves other financial metrics. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Big data; Board committees; Corporate boards; Governance; Strategic decisions; Sustainability risks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097233644"

Taiwan's forklift industry (TFI) belongs to SMEs that it is indispensable from construction engineering, but the related research has always been lacking to improve their competitiveness and sustainability. We refer to the relevant literature and expert opinions and use the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to verify and rank the 18 factors that affect financial factors in TFI. We summarized these factors into four financial facets, including profits, workforce, holding cost, and stock-out cost. Then, the MCGP-U model is used to find the optimal solution for TFI and Komatsu Forklift Taiwan (KFT). In addition, KFT is taken as an example to ensure decision-makers (DMs) remain KFT in a better financial status and competitive advantages under uncertain business environment. As a result, the MCGP-U model optimizes the four financial facets better than by the rule of thumb in KFT, especially in the holding cost section achieving savings as high as 55.9%.

Unless the country generates enough revenue to meet its gross financing needs, the prospect of borrowing more remains strong. Given the complexity of the Lebanese economy and debt structure, the formulation of fiscal and monetary policy is difficult and costly. Hence, policymakers are continuously confronted with difficult choices and must select the choice that is the least destructive. The choice between short-term economic stability and medium-term fiscal sustainability is a clear example of the dilemmas that confront policymakers. In addition, procyclicality and its repercussions on economic growth and the lack of responses to fiscal needs are matters of significant importance for public debt and fiscal sustainability. Hence, this study provides an in-depth analysis of the difficulties facing the Lebanese economy as it tries to sustain its public debt and the overall fiscal deficit. The study calculates the cyclically adjusted balance to analyze the appropriateness of fiscal policy and to assess the role of the automatic stabilizers. Additionally, the study employs a multivariate vector autoregression to forecast the variables in the simple debt model and to identify the impulses needed from various endogenous shocks. The derived results demonstrate that fiscal policy is predominately procyclical, that policymakers risked short-term economic stability for the sake of medium-term fiscal sustainability, and that unless the government adjusts its fiscal behavior, triggers automatic stabilizers, and negotiates a better deal with resident lenders, the economy will further deteriorate. © 2020 Economic Research Forum.","cyclically adjusted balance; debt restructuring in Lebanon; Financial crisis in Lebanon; public debt and fiscal sustainability; stochastic simulation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087086604"

The diagnosis of faults using knowledge discovery techniques has become an essential component of the process, accounting to the challenges faced by the electrical power monitoring systems. The system’s operators employ various energy management techniques which play important roles in the overall management, reliability and operational sustainability of smart grid utilities. Sometimes, these systems are disrupted by events like a short circuit in the system or any external incursion that could pose a threat to the public safety as well as to the critical infrastructure of the grid. This paper aims at providing a robust system for fault diagnosis using the status of an intelligent electronic device and circuit breakers which can be tripped by any kind of fault. To protect the system from vulnerabilities and different kinds of faults, a multilayered fault estimation classifier, based on the Dominance based rough set is proposed. This technique provides an effective solution to the system’s operator for the proper diagnosis of the faults and intrusions by classifying the state of the system. In addition to this, the operator can take preventative measures to protect the system from further damage. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Anomaly detection; Artificial intelligence (AI); Dominance rough set theory (DRS); Fault diagnosis; Smart grid (SG); Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)","Computer aided diagnosis; Data acquisition; Electric circuit breakers; Electric power transmission networks; Failure analysis; Monitoring; Rough set theory; Smart power grids; Anomaly detection; Dominance rough set theory (DRS); Dominance-based rough sets; Intelligent electronic device; Knowledge discovery techniques; Operational sustainability; Smart grid; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975704495"

Initially, in the process of risk assessment, the DEA cross-efficiency method is used to evaluate a set of risk factors obtained from the FMEA. This FMEA-DEA cross-efficiency method not only overcomes some drawbacks of FMEA, but also eliminates several limitations of DEA to offer a high discrimination capability of decision units. For risk treatment and monitoring processes, an ML mechanism is utilized to predict the degree of remaining risk depending on simulated data corresponding to the risk treatment scenario. Prediction using ML is more accurate since the predictive power of this model is better than that of DEA which potentially contains errors. The motivation for this study is that the combination of the DEA and ML approaches gives a flexible and realistic choice in risk management. Based on a case study of logistics business, the results ascertain that the short-term and urgent solutions in service cost and performance are necessary to sustainable logistics operations under the COVID-19 pandemic. The prediction findings show that the risk of skilled personnel is the next concern once the service cost and performance strategies have been prioritised. This approach allow decision-makers to assess the risk level for handling forthcoming events in unusual conditions. It also serves as a useful knowledge repository such that appropriate risk mitigation strategies can be planned and monitored. The outcome of our empirical evaluation indicates that the proposed approach contributes towards robustness in sustainable business operations. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial neural network (ANN); Data envelopment analysis (DEA); DEA cross-efficiency; failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA); machine learning (ML); risk management","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Empirical evaluations; Failure mode and effect analysis; Knowledge repository; Logistics service provider; Machine learning approaches; Monitoring process; Risk mitigation strategy; Sustainable business; Risk management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111006957"

The objective of this work is to identify samples of this random field which yield extreme response as a means to: study the law of the input conditioned on rare events and predict if a random field sample causes such an event. This differs from reliability engineering which focuses on computation of failure probabilities. We investigate two classification schemes that identify these samples of interest: physics-based indicators which are functionals of the input random field and surrogate models which approximate the response. As an alternative to these approaches, we propose a general framework consisting of two stages that combines the use of a physics-based surrogate model and a machine learning classifier. In the first stage, a multifidelity surrogate that requires infrequent evaluations of the full model is designed. This surrogate is then used to generate a sufficient number of samples of random fields that yield extreme events to train a machine learning classifier in the second stage. We study the analytical properties required of the surrogate model and demonstrate through numerical examples the synergy of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Extreme events; Rare event sampling; Support vector machines; Surrogate models; Uncertainty quantification","Clustering algorithms; Differential equations; Support vector machines; Analytical properties; Classification scheme; Extreme events; Failure Probability; Number of samples; Reliability engineering; Surrogate model; Uncertainty quantifications; Learning systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080942248"

When extreme precipitation possesses strong spatial dependence, the risk of flooding is amplified due to catchment factors such as topography that cause runoff accumulation. Temporal dependence can also increase flood risk as storm water drainage systems operating at capacity can be overwhelmed by heavy precipitation occurring over multiple days. While transformed Gaussian processes are common choices for modeling precipitation, their weak tail dependence may lead to underestimation of flood risk. Extreme value models such as the generalized Pareto processes for threshold exceedances and max-stable models are attractive alternatives, but are difficult to fit when the number of observation sites is large, and are of little use for modeling the bulk of the distribution, which may also be of interest to water management planners. While the atmospheric dynamics governing precipitation are complex and difficult to fully incorporate into a parsimonious statistical model, non-mechanistic analogue methods that approximate those dynamics have proven to be promising approaches to capturing the temporal dependence of precipitation. In this paper, we present a Bayesian analogue method that leverages large, synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns to make precipitation forecasts. Changing spatial dependence across varying intensities is modeled as a mixture of spatial Student-t processes that can accommodate both strong and weak tail dependence. The proposed model demonstrates improved performance at capturing the distribution of extreme precipitation over Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) 5.2 forecasts.

As such, several data mining and machine learning approaches have been developed for computation of credit scores over the last few decades. Moreover, the existing rule-based classification algorithms tend to generate a number of rules with a large number of conditions in the antecedent part. However, these algorithms fail to demonstrate high predictive accuracy while balancing coverage and simplicity. Thus, it becomes quite a challenging task for the researchers to generate an optimal rule set with high predictive accuracy. In this paper, we present an effective rule based classification technique for the prediction of credit risk using a novel Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) method. The novel BBO in the context of rule mining is named as locally and globally tuned biogeography based rule-miner (LGBBO-RuleMiner). This is applied for discovering optimal rule set with high predictive accuracy from the dataset containing both the categorical and continuous attributes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against a variety of rule-miners such as OneR (1R), PART, JRip, Decision Table, Conjunctive Rule, J48, and Random Tree, along with some meta-heuristic based rule mining techniques by considering two credit risk datasets obtained from University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository.

Accordingly, an effective management of risks throughout the project's supply chain is critical to avoid time and cost overruns, that if not controlled properly, will ultimately result in project failure. Despite the great significance of this issue, there is a gap between the literature and practice of project risk management, where managers mostly prefer to rely on their own experiences rather than using available analytical tools. On the other hand, the application of the best practices (such as supply chain management and supply chain risk management) from the manufacturing industry in the service industry is highly neglected. To this end, these two gaps are bridged by proposing a comprehensive supply chain risk management approach for construction projects that uses, grounded theory, fuzzy cognitive mapping, and grey relational analysis. A real world case study is presented to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Various risk mitigation scenarios are developed and evaluated by the proposed approach. These scenarios are ranked and the best risk mitigation scenarios are identified. By comparing the proposed approach with similar researches in the literature, it is shown that the proposed approach is capable of capturing and representing expert's perceptions of risks in an effective and time efficient manner. Moreover, decision-makers are enabled to simulate the long term effects of different risk mitigation strategies on the risks and make more informed decisions. Along with the novel approach proposed, the major contribution of this study is setting the stage for a discussion between project management field's scholars and practitioners with those in the manufacturing industry to benefit from an opportunity for mutual growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy cognitive maps; Grey relational analysis; Grounded theory; Project risk management; Supply chain risk management","Cognitive systems; Manufacture; Project management; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Supply chain management; Fuzzy cognitive map; Grey relational analysis; Grounded theory; Project risk management; Supply chain risk management; Risk management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057259223"

It is therefore inevitable to investigate the reliability of such defenses for extreme events as have occurred in the past and are discussed to happen more frequently in the future and due to climate changes. The first subproject in XtremRisK (SP 1) and the related papers in this issue [Gönnert, G. and Gerkensmeier, B.

These results can now be used as input for investigating the reliability of flood defenses and provide an overall failure probability for different types of defenses and different failure modes. This paper therefore summarizes the key findings of the ""risk pathway"" analysis of XtremRisK Subproject 2 (SP 2) which comprise a reliability analysis and breach modeling of coastal and estuarine flood defenses using storm surge scenarios and sea states, including their occurrence probabilities provided by XtremRisK SP 1. The paper discusses the key results, the progress, and challenges in reliability analysis and breach modeling of flood defenses. The developed and advanced methods were applied to pilot sites in Hamburg (Elbe Estuary) and the Island of Sylt (North Sea). These pilot sites are mainly protected by linear flood defenses such as sea dikes, estuarine dikes, coastal dunes, and flood defense walls. Results have shown that under extreme conditions many dikes may fail simply from wave overtopping and even overflow but also from dike breaching due to the severe loading of the dike slopes when heavy overtopping and overflow occurs. The inflowing water volumes were calculated based on time-dependent water levels and then used for inundation modeling of the hinterland in Subproject 3 (SP 3) of XtremRisK. Furthermore, the limit state equations for wave overtopping and overflow had been adapted to time-dependent simulations. An importance factor was introduced for the probability of breaching of sea dikes leading to significantly different failure probabilities. The length effect considering the different homogeneous segments in the dike ring of Hamburg-Wilhelmsburg was estimated using an upper and lower bound approach showing the importance of the segmentation of the dike ring. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company and Japan Society of Civil Engineers.","breach modeling; failure modes; failure probability; flood defenses; Reliability analysis; time-dependent limit state equations","Climate change; Equations of state; Estuaries; Failure modes; Floods; Hydraulic structures; Levees; Network security; Neural networks; Ocean currents; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Storms; Water levels; Water waves; Failure Probability; Flood defense; Hydrodynamic modelling; Limit state equations; Occurrence probability; Statistical assessment; Time dependent simulation; Upper and lower bounds; Reliability analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928765226"

However, MEC deployments today lack flexible IoT device data handling such as handling user preferences for real-time versus energy-efficient processing. Moreover, MEC can also benefit from a policy-based edge routing to handle sustained performance levels with efficient energy consumption. In this paper, we study the potential of MEC to address application issues related to energy management on constrained IoT devices with limited power sources, while also providing low-latency processing of visual data being generated at high resolutions. Using a facial recognition application that is important in disaster incident response scenarios, we propose a novel 'offload decision-making' algorithm that analyzes the tradeoffs in computing policies to offload visual data processing (i.e., to an edge cloud or a core cloud) at low-to-high workloads. This algorithm also analyzes the impact on energy consumption in the decision-making under different visual data consumption requirements (i.e., users with thick clients or thin clients). To address the processing-throughput versus energy-efficiency tradeoffs, we propose a 'Sustainable Policy-based Intelligence-Driven Edge Routing' algorithm that uses machine learning within Mobile Ad hoc Networks. This algorithm is energy aware and improves the geographic routing baseline performance (i.e., minimizes impact of local minima) for throughput performance sustainability, while also enabling flexible policy specification. We evaluate our proposed algorithms by conducting experiments on a realistic edge and core cloud testbed in the GENI Cloud infrastructure, and recreate disaster scenes of tornado damages within simulations. Our empirical results show how MEC can provide flexibility to users who desire energy conservation over low latency or vice versa in the visual data processing with a facial recognition application. In addition, our simulation results show that our routing approach outperforms existing solutions under diverse user preferences, node mobility, and severe node failure conditions. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Energy-aware Edge Routing; Low-latency Visual Data Processing; Mobile Edge Computing; Policy-based Cloud Management","Commerce; Data handling; Decision making; Edge computing; Emergency services; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Face recognition; Green computing; Internet of things; Learning systems; Mobile ad hoc networks; Mobile cloud computing; Optical data processing; Cloud managements; Energy aware; Mobile ad-hoc network (MANETs); Mobile Edge Computing; Real time decision-making; Sustained performance; Throughput performance; Visual data processing; Power management (telecommunication)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051804140"

This paper aims to fit multivariate time series of paddy production variables using copula functions and predicts the next year event based on the data of five countries in southeast Asia. In particular, the most appropriate marginal distribution for each univariate time series was first identified using maximum likelihood parameter estimation method. Next, we performed multivariate copula fitting using two types of copula families, namely, elliptical copula family and Archimedean copula family. Elliptical copula family studied are normal and t copula, while Archimedean copula family considered are Joe, Clayton and Gumbel copulas. The performance of marginal distribution and copula fitting was examined using Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. Finally, we used the best fitted copula model to forecast the succeeding event. In order to assess the performance of copula function, we computed the forecast means and estimation errors of copula function with a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model as reference group. Based on the smallest AIC, the majority of the data favoured the Gumbel copula, which belongs to Archimedean copula family as well as extreme value copula family. Likewise, applying the historical data to forecast the future trends may assist all relevant stakeholders, for instance government, NGO agencies, and professional practitioners in making informed decisions without compromising the environmental as well as economical sustainability in the region. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Archimedean copula family; Dependence structure; Elliptical copula family; Paddy production","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102621099"

The SDGs represent commitments to reduce poverty, hunger, ill health, gender inequality, environmental degradation, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. If a typical reductionist approach is employed to address and optimize individual goals, it may lead to a failure in technological, policy, or managerial development interventions through unintended consequences in other goals. This study uses a systems approach to understand the fundamental dynamics between the SDGs in order to identify potential synergies and antagonisms. A conceptual system model was constructed to illustrate the causal relationships between SDGs, examine system structures using generic system archetypes, and identify leverage points to effectively influence intentional and minimize unintentional changes in the system. The structure of interactions among the SDGs reflects three archetypes of system behavior: Reinforcing Growth, Limits to Growth, and Growth and Underinvestment. The leverage points identified from the conceptual model are gender equality, sustainable management of water and sanitation, alternative resources, sustainable livelihood standards, and global partnerships. Such a conceptual system analysis of SDGs can enhance the likelihood that the development community will broaden its understanding of the potential synergistic benefits of their projects on resource management, environmental sustainability, and climate change. By linking the interactions and feedbacks of those projects with economic gains, women's empowerment, and educational equality, stakeholders can recognize holistic improvements that can be made to the quality of life of many of the world's poor. © 2016 THE AUTHORS","Causal loop diagram; Environmental protection; Gender; Resource recovery; Sanitation; Sustainability; Systems thinking","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Environmental protection; Natural resources; Planning; Sanitation; Water management; Causal loop diagrams; Environmental sustainability; Gender; Professional disciplines; Resource recovery; Sustainable management; Systems thinking; Unintended consequences; Sustainable development","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020539257"

Impact mitigation through access to reliable and timely weather forecasts and other adaptive mechanisms are foremost in Africa's policy dialogues and socio-economic development agendas. This paper analyzed the factors influencing access to forecasts on incidence of pests/diseases (PD) and start of rainfall (SR). The data were collected by Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and analyzed with Probit regression separately for East Africa, West Africa and the combined dataset. The results show that 62.7% and 56.4% of the farmers from East and West Africa had access to forecasts on start of rainfall, respectively. In addition, 39.3% and 49.4% of the farmers from East Africa indicated that forecasts on outbreak of pests/diseases and start of rainfall were respectively accompanied with advice as against 18.2% and 41.9% for West Africa. Having received forecasts on start of rainfall, 24.0% and 17.6% of the farmers from East and West Africa made decisions on timing of farming activities respectively. Probabilities of having access to forecasts on PD significantly increased with access to formal education, farm income and previous exposure to climatic shocks. Furthermore, probabilities of having access to forecasts on SR significantly increased (p < 0.05) with access to business income, radio and perception of more erratic rainfall, among others. It was recommended that promotion of informal education among illiterate farmers would enhance their climatic resilience, among others. © 2015 by the authors.","Forecasts; Perception; Pests/diseases; Resilience; Start of rainfall; Unfavorable weather","East Africa; West Africa; agricultural development; baseline survey; climate change; data set; disease incidence; ecosystem resilience; education; farmers knowledge; food security; mitigation; policy approach; probability; rainfall; risk assessment; socioeconomic status; sustainability; weather forecasting; agricultural production; climate effect; decision making; educational development; farming system; forecasting method; planning method; reliability analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949520992"

To enjoy the power of them, the human society needs solutions to transform the energies mentioned above into electric energy, at specific reliability, efficiency and sustainability parameters. Maintaining this kind of parameters implies, among other things, the careful and permanent monitoring of equipment. The monitoring process implies remote monitoring, as we are talking about preserving natural resources. The equipment is mostly situated in the middle of nature, covering large areas mostly outside of populated locations. In their great majority installations for wind and solar energy have been designed and manufactured relatively recently, which makes them contain systems of tele-monitoring that are designed and included by default, as a part of great importance to the entire investment. The situation is different in the case of hydroelectric plants, which have a tradition of over 130 years and have been and are still built to this day. Renewable energy sources are being increasingly used and need to be constantly monitored for optimizing the power grid. Unfortunately, such micro power plants are located in difficult to access remote locations where often only satellite or sparse GSM radio signals are available. In this paper we study the way how to process big data gathered by a decentralized cloud system, based on general systems and remote telemetry units (RTUs), for tele-monitoring of renewable energy objectives. Also, we analyze a proposed cloud M2M system, where each RTU communicates by radio with a telemetry data gateway connected to a cloud computing infrastructure equipped with appropriate software that delivers processed data. Furthermore, we present how we use a search based application built on Exalead CloudView to search for weak signals in big data. In particular, given the telemetry application, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different sensor signals and data from other online environmental wireless sensor networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between renewable energies and environmental related issues faster and better than trivial mining of sensor data. As a consequence, the software has a significant potential for matching environmental applications and challenges that are related in non-obvious ways. Finally, we present the measurement results for a hydro-energy case study and discuss the applicability for other renewable sources such as solar or wind energy. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Big data; Cloud; IoT; M2M; Renewable energy","Application programs; Clouds; Data handling; Distributed computer systems; Electric power transmission networks; Gateways (computer networks); Greenhouse gases; Investments; Machine-to-machine communication; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Telemetering equipment; Wind power; Wireless sensor networks; Cloud computing infrastructures; Environmental applications; Existing problems; Hydroelectric plant; Innovative solutions; Monitoring process; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Big data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961115320"

Ergonomic problems faced by the workers largely impact the health of individuals and also the productivity of a firm. Based on experts' opinions and a literature survey, three emerging categories-namely, occupational disease, personal factors, and the industrial environment-with a total of twenty factors were identified to examine symmetrical impact in five leather garment companies. In this research work, Cronbach's α was evaluated to check the validity of the ergonomic factors identified through the literature survey. Then, using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), the identified ergonomic factors were evaluated. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to validate the robustness of the results obtained using the integrated approach. Outdated machinery, vibration, operational setup, fatigue, and poor ventilation and lighting are the top five factors inducing ergonomic-related problems and hampering the production of the leather garment companies in India. These top ergonomic factors are the result of a failure in the provision of an ambient working environment. Providing ergonomically designed working environments may lower the occurrence of ergonomic problems. The findings of this study will assist industrial managers to enhance production rate and to progress towards social sustainability in Indian SMEs. The proposed symmetrical assessment in this study could also be considered as a benchmark for other companies in which human-machine interaction is significant. © 2020 by the authors.","Ergonomic factors; Fuzzy AHP; Sensitivity analysis; Social sustainability","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090823293"

This paper proposes an intelligent reactive approach that utilizes Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (GANN) for classification of cloud server consumer to minimize the effect of EDoS attacks and will be beneficial to small and medium size organizations. EDoS attack encounters the illegal traffic so t he work is progressed into two phases: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used to determine affected path and to detect suspected service provider out of the detected affected route which further consist of training and testing phase. The properties of every server are optimized by using an appropriate fitness function of Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on energy consumption of server. ANN considered these properties to train the system to distinguish between the genuine overwhelmed server and EDoS attack affected server.

Through effective utilization of condition monitoring and prediction information, CBM would enhance equipment reliability leading to reduction in maintenance cost. The proposed framework uses a CBM optimization method that utilizes a new linguistic interval-valued fuzzy reasoning method for predicting the information. The proposed big data analytics framework in our study for estimating the uncertainty based on backward feature elimination and fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm prediction errors, is an innovative contribution to the remaining life prediction field.

Therefore, structural health inspections of these bridges are becoming critically important, especially after extreme events. To enhance the efficiency of such an inspection, in recent years, autonomous damage detection based on computer vision has become a research hotspot. This article proposes a three-level image-based approach for post-disaster inspection of the reinforced concrete bridge using deep learning with novel training strategies. The convolutional neural network for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are, respectively, proposed to conduct system-level failure classification, component-level bridge column detection, and local damage-level damage localization. To enable efficient training and prediction using a small data set, the model robustness is a crucial aspect to be taken into account, generally through its hyperparameters’ selection. This article, based on Bayesian optimization, proposes a principled manner of such selection, with which very promising results (well over 90% accuracies) and robustness are observed on all three-level deep learning models. © 2018 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering","","Concrete bridges; Damage detection; Disasters; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Object detection; Railroad bridges; Reinforced concrete; Semantics; Bayesian optimization; Convolutional neural network; Critical component; Damage localization; Failure classification; Semantic segmentation; Training strategy; Transportation infrastructures; Bayesian analysis; bridge; column; damage; design; detection method; disaster management; image analysis; optimization; reinforced concrete; Deep learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057769711"

The analysis covers 40 International Development Association (IDA) countries from 1990 to 2010 and focuses on three types of debt: GDP-indexed loans; export-indexed loans; inflation- indexed loans denominated in local currency. The insurance that indexed debt might offer against macroeconomic shocks depends on the conditional covariances of GDP growth, real exchange-rate depreciation, and net exports that we estimate as the covariances of the forecast errors obtained from a vector autoregression (VAR) model. The analysis shows that both GDP-indexed loans and inflationindexed local-currency loans would help to stabilize the debt ratio of the majority of IDA countries in our sample. However, the adverse policy incentives created by local currency debt tends to favour GDP-indexed debt. The cost of indexation would be small; the estimation of a capital asset pricing model (CAPM) suggests that loans indexed to GDP could be introduced at current interest rates since the estimated risk premium is less than 1 per cent. Any additional risk for multilateral lenders would be more than offset by a lower frequency of debt crises. © The Authors 2015.","Debt sustainability; Export-indexed debt; GDP-indexed debt; Local currency debt; Low-income countries; Multilateral loans; Risk insurance; VAR forecasting","cost-benefit analysis; currency; debt; developing world; export; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; lending behavior; low income population","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84950151368"

This data is also highly promissory. But as this paper argues, such data fails both consumers and citizens. The governance of climate change seemingly requires a strong foundation of data on emission sources. Economists approach climate change as a market failure, where the optimisation of the atmosphere is to be evidence based and data driven. Citizens or consumers, state or private agents of control, all require deep access to information to judge emission realities. Whether we are interested in state-led or in neoliberal ‘solutions’ for either democratic participatory decision-making or for preventing market failure, companies’ emissions need to be known. This paper draws on 20 months of ethnographic fieldwork in a Fortune 50 company’s environmental accounting unit to show how carbon reporting interferes with information symmetry requirements, which further troubles possibilities for contesting data. A material-semiotic analysis of the data practices and infrastructures employed in the context of corporate emissions disclosure details the situated political economies of data labour along the data processing chain. The explicit consideration of how information asymmetries are socially and computationally shaped, how contexts are shifted and how data is systematically straightened out informs a reflexive engagement with Big Data.

When big banks become unstable and vulnerable,‎they typically stop lending. The resulting credit squeeze pushes the economy into recession or a slow growth path. The present study‎examines the financial stability and sustainability of the 30 large banks operating in the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries. These‎banks represent 70% of the GCC banking market. Monte Carlo simulation was attempted assuming that key drivers can vary randomly‎by twenty percent on either side of the current values. The conclusions are drawn based on 300 simulation trails of the five-year forecast‎balance and income statement of each bank. Year 2020 is not favorable for the GCC countries because of the COVID-19 pandemic and low‎oil prices, though the future years may be better. The study identifies several banks, which may become financially unsustainable because‎the simulations indicate the possibility of negative profitability, unacceptably low capital ratios and potential for heavy credit losses during‎periods of economic turbulence, which is the current situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results of the research demonstrate that sustainability of representatives of high-tech industries depends on the specifics of generation and integration of innovations, while for representatives of low-tech industries this factor is of little significance. As a result, two fundamentally different tools are proposed to ensure sustainability of enterprise development. For low-tech industrial enterprises it is a model for predicting the level of sustainability of counterparty development based on a real option, and for high-tech industrial enterprises, it is a model for evaluating the prospects of innovative solutions based on fuzzy logic. The formed tools, if used by industrial enterprises and public institutions, will help to balance the development of industry and, as a result, will allow the country to obtain stable competitive positions in the global economy. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.","Bankruptcy; Economic growth; Financial condition; Fuzzy set theory; High-tech industry; Low-tech industry; Qualitative change; Real option; Sustainable development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059040237"

A review of existing approaches to the formation of such a set of models showed a number of limitations, the result of which is a low forecasting accuracy. The proposed approach, unlike the existing ones, allows to: 1) determine the optimal dimension of the information space of diagnostic factors; 2) find the optimal number of classes of situations for which differentiated management strategies can be developed; 3) determine the period of pre-emption, which does not require updating the models of retrospective diagnostics.

T2FIP can effectively tackle uncertainties expressed as a hybrid of type-2 fuzzy sets and interval numbers. In T2FIP, tradeoff between system benefit and system reliability can be analyzed to obtain the practical modeling outputs. Solution method based on interactive algorithm and type reduction technique is proposed to transform fuzzy-interval constraint into its deterministic equivalents. The T2FIP method is then applied to conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater in the Zhangweinan River Basin, China. Scenarios associated with different groundwater utilization ratios are examined to help generate the optimal conjunctive water use pattern. Results show that increased groundwater utilization ratio could lead to increased crop area and system benefit; however, when the utilization ratio of groundwater for irrigation increases to 50%, the system benefit would not increase. Results reveal that, for arid and semi-arid regions, effective conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is critical for guaranteeing the agricultural sustainability. These findings can help identify desired decision alternatives among crop planning, agricultural irrigation, and groundwater utilization with a maximized system benefit and a minimized system-failure risk. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 1,078 firms from 15 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. A maximisation weighted ratio is estimated by applying OptQuest algorithms to measure the portfolio performance considering a fuzzy Jensen’s alpha and the percentage of the portfolio’s performance that exceeds the market. Findings: The results show a similar financial performance in sustainable portfolios (SP) and non-SP, but considering the uncertainty, the performance in sustainable firms was better than that of non-sustainable ones. Uncertainty was reduced, as it passed the beginning of the crisis from 2008-2009 to 2012-2013. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is the different assessments of sustainability indexes in each of the countries. Practical implications: The results help investors assess their decisions in an uncertain economic environment and allocate their investment in not only financial terms but also social character. Social implications: Countries with higher financial performances in SP show the efficiency in their legal environmental regulations. On the other hand, the degree of uncertainty is lower in the SP than non-SP, suggesting that sustainable firms in financial crisis could be more responsible in social claims such as good working conditions. Originality/value: This study contributes to existing research in two ways. First, the paper studies corporate social responsibility by different continents and countries in an uncertain economic timespan. For this, the legal, cultural and socioeconomic divergences and convergences were explored. Second, the research presented an analysis of the financial performance differences between sustainable and non-SP by applying a hybrid methodology with fuzzy regression and OptQuest algorithms. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fuzzy Jensen’s alpha; OptQuest algorithm; Portfolio theory; Sustainable portfolios","Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental regulations; Finance; Laws and legislation; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Degree of uncertainty; Design/methodology/approach; Financial performance; Multi-criteria approach; Organisation for economic co-operation and development; Portfolio theories; Sustainable portfolios; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011708767"

That is, the financialization literature lacks an adequate microfoundation. Accounting for the drivers of financialization processes solely at the macro level overlooks the problems of how these processes came about and whether they are sustainable. This paper addresses this explanatory gap, arguing that a key independent microeconomic driver of increasing financialization did exist: the incessant efforts by money-centre banks in the USA to break out of Depression-era restrictions on their size, activities, and markets. These banks' growth strategies in turbulent times led to an institutional (meso) shift - the rise of a megabank-centred shadow banking system - that now shapes global financial architecture even while operating in ways that are unsustainable. In short, too-big-to-manage megabanks are at the heart of the fragility and instability of the economy today. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Mean HAART costs were €9,377±€3,501 (range 782-29,852) per year, with remarkable site-based differences, possibly related to the different composition of local assisted populations. Percentages of patients on viral suppression were homogeneously high across all study sites. The factors identified by cross-validation were line of HAART, diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, current CD4 T-cell count, and detectable HIV viremia >50 copies/mL. In the final multivariable model, HAART costs were independently directly associated with more advanced HAART line (P<0.001) and inversely correlated with current CD4 T-cell count (P=0.024). Site of care held independent prediction of higher costs, with marked control of expenses at sites 2 (P=0.001) and 5 (P<0.001).; Background: As HIV infection turned into a chronic treatable disease, now ranking as one of the most costly in medicine, long-term sustainability of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) expenses became a major issue, especially in countries with universal access to care. Identification of determinants of higher HAART costs may therefore help in controlling costs of care, while keeping high levels of retention in care and viral suppression.; Methods: With this aim, we enrolled a large multicentric sample of consecutive unselected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients followed at five sites of care in Italy, and evaluated annual individual HAART costs in relation to a number of sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory variables.; Conclusion: Higher costs of HAART were strongly associated with previous treatment failures, detectable HIV viremia, and lower CD4 T-cell count at the time of evaluation, with no correlation at all with sex, age, hepatitis C virus coinfection, and nadir CD4 T-cell counts. Newer drugs, which are typically those associated with high prices, at the time of the analysis were still prevalently prescribed to rescue and maintain viral suppression in patients with more complex treatment history. Further analyses of the contribution of the single drug/regimen to the estimated cost are warranted. © 2015 Feussner et al.","Costs; Current CD4 count; Highly active antiretroviral treatment; Human immunodeficiency virus; Treatment failures; Viremia","antiretrovirus agent; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; drug cost; drug treatment failure; female; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Italy; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; outpatient; prediction; prevalence; retrospective study; social determinants of health; viremia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919790573"

In this paper we examine the process of setting up such a comparison and the metric used. Performance comparisons on Cloud and non-Cloud systems, deployed for biomedical scientists, have been conducted to identify improvements of efficiency and performance. Prior to the experiments, network latency, file size and job failures were identified as factors which degrade performance and experiments were conducted to understand their impacts. Organizational Sustainability Modeling (OSM) is used before, during and after the experiments to ensure fair comparisons are achieved. OSM defines the actual and expected execution time, risk control rates and is used to understand key outputs related to both Cloud and non-Cloud experiments. Forty experiments on both Cloud and non-Cloud systems were undertaken with two case studies. The first case study was focused on transferring and backing up 10,000 files of 1 GB each and the second case study was focused on transferring and backing up 1000 files 10 GB each. Results showed that first, the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud was lower than on the non-Cloud system. Second, there was more than 99% consistency between the actual and expected execution time on the Cloud while no comparable consistency was found on the non-Cloud system. Third, the improvement in efficiency was higher on the Cloud than the non-Cloud. OSM is the metric used to analyze the collected data and provided synthesis and insights to the data analysis and visualization of the two case studies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The only exceptions are the extreme value based models which correctly forecast the true level of upside and downside risk. We also investigate the closeness of fit of theoretical distributions to the extreme tails of CROBEX returns. Results show that generalised Pareto distribution, which has a sound theoretical foundation, provides the best fit to both tails of CROBEX returns. We find that distribution tails differ significantly, with the right tail having a higher tail index, indicative of more extreme events.","CROBEX; Emerging markets; Extreme value theory; Value at risk; Zagreb stock exchange","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77950449469"

Incompatible production processes among farming systems may lead to spatial conflicts and production losses between neighboring farms, and the magnitude of such losses may depend not only on the scale of each activity, but also on patterns of land use. Such conflicts can be classified as ""edge-effect externalities""-spatial externalities whose marginal impacts decrease as distance from the border generating the negative impact increases. This paper tests the hypothesis that edge-effect externalities have influenced the location and production patterns of certified organic farms, using data from California Central Valley certified organic farmers. Using concepts from landscape ecology and spatial statistics, we investigate difference in parcel geometry and surrounding land uses between organic and non-organic parcels. Using a generalized method of moments (GMM) spatially autoregressive econometric model, we demonstrate that both parcel geometry and surrounding land uses influence the probability of a given parcel being certified organic. We conclude with suggestions for policies to encourage development of organic farming regions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Since various risks and uncertainties exist in a project which may not only prevent the project to be completed within budget and time limit, but also threaten the quality, safety and operational needs. In the proposed method the potential project risks are taken into account and risk response strategies are developed by fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) and then varying effects of each risk over each activity. The project total time can then be quantified and simulated by Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) as an effective technique in uncertain conditions due to its capability of converting uncertainty to risk judgmentally in projects. Following this procedure fault tree analysis and event tree analysis will be used to get risk mitigations. Eventually, for a reliable schedule we distribute a critical chain schedule which allows one to implement the project as planned and obtain reasonable feeding buffer time and project buffer time. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

The possibility to develop some new tools, as exploratory model, open new possibility research to forecast complex adaptive model and to predict Technological Extreme Events on SOC system. Whereas complex adaptive systems and agent-based models of them originally seemed to pose a problem for policy analysis, they may also present an opportunity. The failure of computerized decision support systems to provide significant help for most problems is striking when contrasted with the impact of computer technology in other spheres. Looking back, we can now see that most policy problems involve complex and adaptive systems, and that for those problems the classical approaches of predictive modeling and optimization that have been used in decision support software are not appropriate.

We introduce a general process for transforming historical electrical grid data into models that aim to predict the risk of failures for components and systems. These models can be used directly by power companies to assist with prioritization of maintenance and repair work. Specialized versions of this process are used to produce 1) feeder failure rankings, 2) cable, joint, terminator, and transformer rankings, 3) feeder Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) estimates, and 4) manhole events vulnerability rankings. The process in its most general form can handle diverse, noisy, sources that are historical (static), semi-real-time, or real-time, incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for prioritization (supervised ranking or MTBF), and includes an evaluation of results via cross-validation and blind test. Above and beyond the ranked lists and MTBF estimates are business management interfaces that allow the prediction capability to be integrated directly into corporate planning and decision support; such interfaces rely on several important properties of our general modeling approach: that machine learning features are meaningful to domain experts, that the processing of data is transparent, and that prediction results are accurate enough to support sound decision making. We discuss the challenges in working with historical electrical grid data that were not designed for predictive purposes. The rawness of these data contrasts with the accuracy of the statistical models that can be obtained from the process; these models are sufficiently accurate to assist in maintaining New York City's electrical grid. © 2011 IEEE.","Applications of machine learning; computational sustainability; electrical grid; knowledge discovery; reliability; smart grid; supervised ranking","Data handling; Data mining; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Industry; Learning systems; Maintainability; Metadata; Preventive maintenance; Reliability; Repair; Blind test; Business management; Corporate planning; Cross validation; Decision supports; Domain experts; Electrical grids; Knowledge discovery method; Mean time between failures; Modeling approach; New York City; Power company; Power grids; Prediction capability; Prioritization; Repair works; Risk of failure; Smart grid; Statistical models; supervised ranking; Learning algorithms","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84055217877"

For default emission Eo, numerical relative risk is expressed as Ro = PEC/PNEC. Using the risk limit Ro ≥ 1, the risk emission is RE = Eo/Ro. PEC can be estimated by the fate modeling. Our FATEMOD model computes the fate of chemicals in an environment defined as a catchment area. In this model, the substance properties (liquid state) of vapour pressure Pl, water solubility S, Henry's law coefficient H (Pl/S), lipophility Kow, and the reaction half-life times are automatically computed as a function of temperature. This feature is unique, thus far, in fate models. The physical properties in the environmental temperature range are obtained from the equation: Log Prop(i) = Ai - Bi /T (T in degrees Kelvin). We have learnt to determine the coefficients Apl,Bpl (for Pl), As,Bs (for S), Ah,Bh (for H) and Aow,Bow (for Kow) from thermodynamic equations of these properties as functions of molecular parameters and temperature T by dividing the equation into two parts: 1) T absent and 2) T present. The results compare well with expensive direct measurement results and also with results from retention time comparisons by temperature-controlled GC (for PI) and HPLC (for S). In reasonable risk predictions for variable climates such as in Nordic countries, the ambient temperature cannot be ignored. Examples of temperature-adjusting FATEMOD runs in chemical risk estimations are given.","Degradation rates; Physical properties; Regional model; Relative risk; Temperature corrections; Thermodynamics","Chemicals; Environmental impact; Pressure effects; Solubility; Thermodynamics; Vapors; Water; Degradation rates; Regional model; Relative risk; Temperature corrections; Risk assessment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-36148979375"

We show how the design of an ""optimal"" model for policy makers focuses on the choice of three parameters: the degree of risk aversion of failing to anticipate an event, the forecast horizon of the model, and the probability threshold for extracting warning signals. Based on a representative EWS model, we find that, for a given degree of risk aversion, there is a unique combination of the forecast horizon and of the probability threshold that maximizes the policy maker's preferences, yielding the best possible model from a policy perspective. Thus the analysis of the paper allows deriving clear policy implications concerning the choice of action, and in particular the timing of measures to be taken by policy-makers if a financial crisis may be looming in the future. © 2007 Society for Policy Modeling.","Crisis prediction; Currency crises; Early warning system; Extreme events; Risk management","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-36849096009"

Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation. © 2009 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.","","Chrysanthemum","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350174323"

India has been promoting integrated watershed management in drought-prone areas to address these constraints. Watershed communities are being assisted to invest in groundwater re-charging facilities. While communities and the public bear such costs, individual farmers capture irrigation benefits. Groundwater is a free common property resource and land users hold de-facto use rights. This has accelerated private irrigation investments and depletion of aquifers resulting in iniquitous distribution of irrigation water. Power subsidies and negligible pumping costs aggravate the problem. These policy failures and low irrigation costs to farmers are displacing water-efficient crops in favor of water-intensive crops in water-scare areas. The paper reviews the village-level externalities that aggravate groundwater depletion and evaluates potential policy options to enhance local collective action in water management. Using 3SLS, an econometric crop-water productivity model is used to evaluate alternative water policy instruments. The results indicate that different types of water user charges can be introduced with modest consequences on profitability and farm incomes. If properly implemented and managed by the local communities, pro-poor policies could bring considerable sustainability benefits and also ensure enhanced equity in access to the resource. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes an indicator of the fiscal stance which computes the fiscal adjustment required to reach a specific debt-GDP targeted given the forecasts of future deficit and interest rates obtained from an unrestricted (recursively-estimated) VAR model. The index is easy to compute and can be decomposed to disclose the different contribution of revenue, expenditure, nominal yields, inflation and growth to the fiscal stance. For this reason it provides a transparent and detailed measure of the fiscal stance, particularly suitable for multi-country surveillance. As a result, the index improves on the tax-gap indicators widely used by governments and international agencies, and is far more informative than formal econometric tests of fiscal sustainability. The time series of the indicator for individual EU countries and the US show that their fiscal position has fluctuated considerably over the last 40 years, and has particularly deteriorated since 2007. The index predicts that the adjustment required to restore pre-crisis debt-GDP levels are higher for high debt countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. They become more severe the shorter is the time horizon for the adjustment. As a large degree of uncertainty surrounds the assessment of the fiscal stance in the medium and long run, we argue that policy makers should inform their policy based on the worst case scenario predicted by the indicator. - Vito Polito and Michael Wickens © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2011.","","Europe; United States; econometrics; economic growth; European Union; expenditure; financial crisis; fiscal policy; Gross Domestic Product; inflation; numerical model; policy making; time series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053513754"

The Pitchford thesis contended that after the floating of the exchange rate the current account deficit was the residual outcome of rational optimizing decisions of private agents and if there was fiscal balance then the policy of targeting the reduction of the current account deficit based on the KMF paradigm was misconceived. Empirical tests based on the application of the net present value criterion using vector autoregressions, unit root and cointegration econometrics reveals that Australia's current account deficit revealed that the current account deficits were unsustainable during the fixed exchange period and over the whole study period 1960q3-2007q4, but not during the floating exchange rate period post-1983q4. Therefore the empirical results gave credibility to the Pitchford thesis but Australian policymakers continued to target the reduction of the current account deficit because their failure to make the paradigm shift from KMF to ITO to be consistent with the regime shift from a fixed to a floating exchange rate. However, in 2004 after more than two decades feuding Australian policymakers accepted the Pitchford thesis and abandon the policy of targeting the reduction of the current account deficit. But the global financial crisis and global recession has delivered a death blow to the Pitchford thesis by undermining the key assumptions of fiscal balance and rationality that underpins it. The fiscal stimulus package that has been implemented to combat the fall in aggregate demand and restore consumer confidence due to the global recession has resulted in massive fiscal imbalance and the credit crunch has undermined rational behavior and consumer confidence. Therefore, the Pitchford thesis no longer rules the policy roost after the global financial crisis. In this study we draw on the conflicting policy perspectives on the unsustainability of high US current account deficits that tender a malign prognosis based on Salvatore's twin deficit hypothesis and a benign prognosis based on Bernanke's global savings glut hypothesis to identify some key policy challenges that confront Australian policymakers to navigate the Australian economy out of the global financial crisis and recession into a robust recovery phase in the near future. © 2009 Society for Policy Modeling.","Australia; Bernanke global savings glut hypothesis; Current account sustainability; Global financial crisis; Paradigm and regime shifts; Pitchford thesis; Salvatore twin deficits hypothesis; Unit root and cointegaration econometrics; Vector autoregressions (VAR)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-74749093346"
